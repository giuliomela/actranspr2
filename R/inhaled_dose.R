#' Compute the inhaled dose of air pollutants by individuals
#'
#' This function computes the daily inhaled dose of PM2.5 for individuals living in
#' different Italian municipalities. The function takes into account the commuting mode and
#' the weekly hours of commuting and physical activity. Total inhaled doses are calculated following Engstr√∂m and Forsberg (2019). It can return the ration between the inhaled dose
#' in the commuting scenario (i.e. by car or bike) and a baseline scenario (no commuting at all).
#'
#' @param city A single character string. The name (in Italian) of the Italian muncipality for which the
#'     scenario must be built. THe full list of city names can be found in the commuting matrix
#'     (see `comm_matrix_cities_km`)
#' @param mode A character string. The transportation mode of interest:  it can assume the following values:
#'     `walk`, `bike` and `ebike`.
#' @param w_phy_act The weekly hours of physical activity.
#' @param w_commuting The weekly hours of commuting.
#' @param commuting_days Number of weekly commuting days. Default is `4`
#' @param experimental_data A logical value. If set to `TRUE` data from the RSE experimentation are used.
#'     Default set to `FALSE`
#' @param working_weeks Number of annual working weeks
#' @param eq_change whether the function returns the equivalent change or not
#' @return Either a vector or a number depending on the `ratio` parameter
