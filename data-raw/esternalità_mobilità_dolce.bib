  abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of reducing the default speed limit from 50 km/h to 40~km/h on traffic safety and drivers' behavior in Edmonton, Canada. The research comprehensively examines collision and speed data to assess the outcomes of the new speed limit. Collision data was analyzed across three distinct periods: pre-COVID (2017--2019), the COVID period (2019--2021), and the after-implementation period (August 2021 to July 2022). Speed surveys were conducted on 219 road segments before and after the implementation of the speed limit change. The study utilized a before-and-after with a comparison group approach to evaluate the impact on collisions, using 50 km/h roads that maintained their speed limit throughout as the comparison group. The impact of the reduced speed limit on road safety was assessed by analyzing collision data for two periods, pre-COVID (2017--2019) and COVID (2019--2021), compared to the period after setting the new speed limit (2021--2022). Two-sample t-tests were employed to examine the change in speeds. The analysis revealed statistically significant reductions in the overall number of collisions and injuries and fatalities resulting from collisions, by 25\% and 31\%, respectively. The study also categorized neighborhoods and roads to demonstrate the areas that experienced the greatest benefits. Speed data showed statistically significant reductions in the average and 85th percentile speeds, with drivers lowering their speeds at 115 locations, accounting for 53\% of the surveyed locations. Moreover, higher speed reductions were observed on local roads compared to collector roads, and narrower roads compared to wider roads.. Overall, the study demonstrates that reducing the speed limit can lead to lower speeds and fewer collisions on the roads, creating a safer road environment for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Additionally, it provides a detailed framework for municipalities to evaluate the effectiveness of their speed limit reduction programs.},

This research work addresses the comparison of trip dynamics, energy consumption, CO 2 and NO x Well-to-Wheel impacts of 5 transportation alternatives (conventional and electric bicycles, conventional and electric vehicles and an urban bus) in Lisbon, Portugal. On-road monitoring of a specific route in Lisbon revealed that bikers using electric bicycles increased their average speed between 8\% and 26\% compared to their use of the conventional bicycle, especially in the route sections with positive slopes (up to 49\% increases). Electric bicycles result in a Tank-to-Wheel energy consumption of 0.028 MJ/km, allowing an average autonomy of 46 km between recharging. When comparing the 5 transportation alternatives, the electric bicycles presented a higher travel time of 13.5\%, 1.9\% and 7.8\% over the bus, low powered electric vehicle, and standard electric vehicle/conventional technologies, respectively. Regarding the Well-to-Wheel energy consumption analysis, the results indicated that, when compared to the other transportation solutions, the electric bicycle only uses 11\%, 3\%, 1\%, 2\% and 4\% of the energy required when using the low powered electric vehicle, standard electric vehicle, conventional gasoline and diesel technologies and bus, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of Well-to-Wheel emissions reveals that the electric bicycle has 13\% and 4\% lower CO 2 emissions and 12\% and 4\% lower NO x emissions when compared to the low powered and standard electric vehicles, respectively. This research work allows sustaining that bicycles can be considered interesting solutions for urban trips, with comparable trip times to other transportation modes, as well as zero local emissions and reduced Well-to- Wheel pollutant impacts, contributing significantly for the improvement of the overall urban air quality.},

  abstract = {Safety-improving countermeasures, such as speed limit reduction policies, often result in higher travel times, but the true effect of these policies on accessibility has remained unknown. Usually, the external costs of transport, like traffic crashes, are neglected in the accessibility analyses in both research and practice. Decreasing the maximum speed is not an unknown measure to improve traffic safety. This research examined how reducing the speed limit, from 50 to 30 km/h, effects job accessibility by car and bicycle in different postcode areas, in the municipality of Amsterdam. This is done by integrating traffic crash risks as a cost component in an accessibility model. Additionally, this research investigated how the impacts of speed limit reductions will be distributed over different areas that differ in terms of the total population aged between 15 and 65, income levels, household sizes, gender and immigration background. The new accessibility model was applied in a scenario analysis based on which the equity impacts of the proposed policy were examined by comparing the impacts of the new policies on changes in the potential job accessibility for car and bike users. For predicting the number of car-to-car and car-to-bicycle crashes with property damage only (PDO) and killed or severely injured (KSI) crash results, a negative binomial model and an empirical Bayes method were used. A power model is used to determine the effects of speed limit reduction on the number of crashes during the morning and evening peak hours. Based on the crash risks and the traffic volume a monetary value is determined for each road segment. The total costs for a road segment are based on this monetary value for crash risk and the travel costs, which are determined based on the travel costs and value of travel time. Then an accessibility model using the contour measure determined the number of jobs that could be reached within a threshold. With the help of a spatial analysis method, Local Moran's I analysis, is determined whether the potential job accessibility is clustered or randomly scattered over the study area. Moreover, to recognize the effects of speed limit reduction on certain population groups in Amsterdam the bivariate Moran's I analysis was performed. With the visualization of this analysis, the equity of accessibility change in Amsterdam for the different population groups could be determined. This research concludes that speed limit reduction reduces the accessibility of most car users while most bicyclists will experience an increase in accessibility. From an equity point of view, with the current accessibility there are clear clusters visible with high accessibility as well as clusters with low accessibility. The policy measure to reduce speed limit is most disadvantaged for car users living in regions with a high percentage of males. For other variables such as the number of active population, median income, average household size and percentage of non-western immigrants, no clear group is benefiting more than other groups. The same five variables were tested on equity for changes in bicycle accessibility and showed that the regions with a high percentage of male inhabitants are negatively affected when it comes to cycling accessibility. Again no indication for the other variables showed that one group is more beneficial than another group.},

  abstract = {Recently, the need to assess personal exposure in different micro-environments has been highlighted. Further, estimating the inhaled dose of pollutants is considerably one of the most interesting parameters to be explored to complete the fundamental information obtained through exposure assessment, especially if associated with a dose-response approach. To analyze the main results obtained from the studies related to the estimation of the inhaled dose of pollutants in different micro-environments (environments in which an individual spends a part of his day), and to identify the influence of different parameters on it, a systematic review of the literature was performed. The principal outcomes from the considered studies outlined that (i) exposure concentration and residence time are among the most important parameters to be evaluated in the estimation of the inhaled dose, especially in transport environments. Further, (ii) the pulmonary ventilation rate can be of particular interest during active commuting because of its increase, which increases the inhalation of pollutants. From a methodological point of view, the advent of increasingly miniaturized, portable and low-cost technologies could favor these kinds of studies, both for the measurement of atmospheric pollutants and the real-time evaluation of physiological parameters used for estimation of the inhaled dose. The main results of this review also show some knowledge gaps. In particular, numerous studies have been conducted for the evaluation (in terms of personal exposure and estimation of the inhaled dose) of different PM fractions: other airborne pollutants, although harmful to human health, are less represented in studies of this type: for this reason, future studies should be conducted, also considering other air pollutants, not neglecting the assessment of exposure to PM. Moreover, many studies have been conducted indoors, where the population spends most of their daily time. However, it has been highlighted how particular environments, even if characterized by a shorter residence time, can contribute significantly to the dose of inhaled pollutants. These environments are, therefore, of particular importance and should be better evaluated in future studies, as well as occupational environments, where the work results in a high pulmonary ventilation rate. The attention of future studies should also be focused on these categories of subjects and occupational studies.},

However, no study has conducted a robust evaluation of the effects of city-\-wide 20\,mph speed limits on road injuries. This study reports the effects of such an intervention, based on a natural experiment that took place in Bristol, UK. Based on a stepped-\-wedge design using count data, negative binomial regressions showed that between 2008 and 2016, the 20\,mph speed limit intervention was associated with a city-\-level reduction of fatal injuries of around 63\% (95\% CI 2\% to 86\%), controlling for trends over time and areas. There was also a general trend of reduction of the total number of injuries at city level and in 20\,mph roads. These findings highlight the potential benefits of city-w\- ide 20\,mph speed limits. We hypothesise that this city-\-wide approach may encourage a general behaviour change in drivers that, in turn, may contribute to reducing injuries across the city.},

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the health benefits associated with e-cycling. Method: A systematic literature review of studies examining physical activity, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and psychological outcomes associated with e-cycling. Where possible these outcomes were compared to those from conventional cycling and walking. Seven electronic databases, clinical trial registers, grey literature and reference lists were searched up to November 2017. Hand searching occurred until June 2018. Experimental or observational studies examining the impact of e-cycling on physical activity and/or health outcomes of interest were included. E- bikes used must have pedals and require pedalling for electric assistance to be provided. Results: Seventeen studies (11 acute experiments, 6 longitudinal interventions) were identified involving a total of 300 participants. There was moderate evidence that e-cycling provided physical activity of at least moderate intensity, which was lower than the intensity elicited during conventional cycling, but higher than that during walking. There was also moderate evidence that e-cycling can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in physically inactive individuals. Evidence of the impact of e-cycling on metabolic and psychological health outcomes was inconclusive. Longitudinal evidence was compromised by weak study design and quality. Conclusion: E-cycling can contribute to meeting physical activity recommendations and increasing physical fitness. As such, e-bikes offer a potential alternative to conventional cycling. Future research should examine the long-term health impacts of e-cycling using rigorous research designs},

  abstract = {Objectives: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in Italy of preventive treatment with ramipril (an angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor) compared to no treatment in patients at high risk of cardiovascular death. The analysis was based on data extracted from the HOPE trial.Methods: The current life table method was used in order to model a lifetime time horizon for outcomes and costs. The cohorts used were 1000 subjects on ramipril, and 1000 subjects on placebo enrolled in the HOPE trial. Kaplan--Meier curves at 5 years of the clinical study were fitted using an exponential model over a lifetime horizon, the outcome variables being myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization and death. Total direct medical costs have been considered from a third-party payer's perspective -- the Italian National Health Service. Resources involved in each event/activity were estimated using the modified Delphi technique with a panel of six clinicians. Types of resources reported included drug therapies, laboratory and imaging tests, physician visits, outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation, as well as medical and surgical hospital admissions. The incremental cost per life year gained was the main measure of the analysis.Results: ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) decreases with the length of the treatment period. After the first year the ICER is {\texteuro}55 062 and subsequently decreases to about {\texteuro}12 770 at 5 years, {\texteuro}5945 at 10 years and {\texteuro}3726 at 20 years. The two ways sensitivity analysis showed that at 5 years ICERs range from a saving of {\texteuro}4059 to a cost of {\texteuro}22 929 (at 20 years they are {\texteuro}1814 and {\texteuro}4434), mainly depending on the cost of drug and cost of events. Previous analyses in other countries based on the HOPE study obtained ICER values which are comparable with our results, when taking into account the different cost structure of the health care systems.Conclusions: On the basis of these results, the use of ramipril is likely to represent an efficient use of public health expenditure in the Italian healthcare system.},

  abstract = {Physical activity has been widely associated with beneficial health effects. The use of electric-assist bicycles (e-bikes) can lead to increased or decreased physical activity, depending on the transport mode substituted. This study aimed to compare physical activity levels of e-bikers and conventional bicycle users (cyclists) as well as across e-bike user groups based on the transport mode substituted by e-bike. Physical activity, transport and user related parameters were analysed. Data from the longitudinal on-line survey of the PASTA project were used. The survey recruited over 10,000 participants in seven European cities. Physical activity levels, measured in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET min/wk), were similar among e-bikers and cyclists (4463 vs. 4085). E-bikers reported significantly longer trip distances for both e-bike (9.4 km) and bicycle trips (8.4 km) compared to cyclists for bicycle trips (4.8 km), as well as longer daily travel distances for e-bike than cyclists for bicycle (8.0 vs. 5.3 km per person, per day, respectively). Travel-related activities of e-bikers who switched from cycling decreased by around 200 MET min/wk., while those switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport gained around 550 and 800 MET min/wk. respectively. Therefore, this data suggests that e-bike use leads to substantial increases in physical activity in e-bikers switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport, while net losses in physical activity in e-bikers switching from cycling were much less due to increases in overall travel distance.},

  abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiology of bicycle-related injuries presenting to United States emergency departments (EDs). Methods The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) database was used to derive national, weighted estimates of nonfatal ED visits for bicycle-related injuries by patient age, sex, diagnosis, injured body part, locale of incident, traffic-relatedness of incident, and month of incident. Results Males accounted for 73\% of all bicycle-related injury ED visits. Patients aged 10 to 14 years represented the 5-year age interval with the highest rate of bicycle injury visits (488 per 10,000). Fifty-six percent of ED visits for bicycle-related injuries came from cyclists who were riding on the street, with increased street ridership in those who were older than 15 years, and 99.7\% of all patient injuries occurring on the street (as opposed to other locations) were related to motor vehicle collisions (MVCs). The head and face were the most injured body parts in the overall population. In addition, the largest proportion of head injuries, relative to total injuries in the age group, occurred in the very young (0 to 4 years) and elderly (65+ years) populations. The leading rider injury diagnoses were contusion, abrasions, and hematomas. The incidence of bicycle-related injuries peaked in the month of July. Conclusions The study identified the characteristics of bicycle-related injuries across various age groups of riders. This information will aid in developing more effective age-appropriate injury prevention strategies. The frequency of MVC-related injuries deserves attention and suggests the need to examine strategies for limiting interactions between moving vehicles and bicyclists.},

  abstract = {The study aims to explore the main drivers influencing the economic appraisal of heat warning systems by integrating epidemiological modelling and benefit-cost analysis. To shed insights on heat wave mortality valuation, we consider three valuation schemes: (i) a traditional one, where the value of a statistical life (VSL) is applied to both displaced and premature mortality; (ii) an intermediate one, with VSL applied for premature mortality and value of a life year (VOLY) for displaced mortality; and (iii) a conservative one, where both premature and displaced mortality are quantified in terms of loss of life expectancy, and then valued using the VOLY approach. When applying these three schemes to Madrid (Spain), we obtain a benefit-cost ratio varying from 12 to 3700. We find that the choice of the valuation scheme has the largest influence, whereas other parameters such as attributable risk, displaced mortality ratio, or the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the heat warning system are less influential. The results raise the question of which is the most appropriate approach to value mortality in the context of heat waves, given that the lower bound estimate for the benefit-cost ratio (option iii using VOLY) is up to two orders of magnitude lower than the value based on the traditional VSL approach (option i). The choice of the valuation methodology has significant implications for public health authorities at the local and regional scale, which becomes highly relevant for locations where the application of the VOLY approach could lead to benefit-cost ratios significantly lower than 1. We propose that specific metrics for premature and displaced VOLYs should be developed for the context of heat waves. Until such values are available, we suggest testing the economic viability of heat warning systems under the three proposed valuation schemes (i--iii) and using values for VOLY commonly applied in air pollution as the health end points are similar. Lastly, periodical reassessment of heat alert plans should be performed by public health authorities to monitor their long-term viability and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of preventable death globally, but can be reduced by introducing speed lowering interventions such as 20 mph or 30\,km/h speed `zones' and `limits'. `Zones' utilise physical traffic calming measures and `limits' only utilise signage and lines. Transport is a social determinant of health and therefore such interventions may in/directly also impact on other health outcomes. Aim To investigate the effect of 20 mph speed `zones' and `limits' on a range of health outcomes, and to establish if there are differences in the effectiveness of 20 mph zones and 20 mph limits. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Transport Research Information Service (TRIS) databases were searched [1983--January 2019) to identify relevant studies. Reference lists, relevant systematic reviews and the grey literature were also searched. Inclusion criteria: 20 mph `zone' or `limit' interventions: and public health outcomes (collisions, casualties, mode of transport, noise pollution, air quality, inequalities and liveability (e.g. physical activity and perceptions of safety)) and including a control/comparison group. Results Eleven studies were identified reporting nine 20 mph `zone' and two 20 mph `limit' interventions. 20 mph `zones' were associated with a reduction in the number and severity of collisions and casualties; have less robust evidence of the effect on air pollution; and have the potential to indirectly impact physical activity and liveability through various mechanisms for change (although currently the evidence is lacking and requires further work). No significant associations were reported between 20 mph `limits' and any public health outcome. Conclusion This review suggests 20 mph `zones' are effective in reducing collisions and casualties. However, it provides insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effect of 20 mph `zones' on pollution, inequalities or liveability. For 20 mph `limits' more rigorous evaluations are required in order to draw robust conclusions.},

In the second and third laboratory visits, sixteen participants completed two cycling bouts, one high-intensity interval exercise and one low-intensity continuous exercise. The minute ventilation and heart rate were measured in both exercises and the validity of the equations tested. The Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement between the minute ventilation and estimated equations for interval and continuous exercise. There was no difference between the minute ventilation obtained from both equations and the minute ventilation directly measured during the interval exercise. However, the quadratic equation underestimated the minute ventilation during continuous exercise (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). While both equations seem to be suitable to estimate minute ventilation during high-intensity interval exercise, the exponential equation is recommended for low-intensity continuous exercise.},

Objective We describe whether the health benefits from the increased physical activity of a modal shift for urban commutes outweigh the health risks. Data sources and extraction We have summarized the literature for air pollution, traffic accidents, and physical activity using systematic reviews supplemented with recent key studies. Data synthesis We quantified the impact on all-cause mortality when 500,000 people would make a transition from car to bicycle for short trips on a daily basis in the Netherlands. We have expressed mortality impacts in life-years gained or lost, using life table calculations. For individuals who shift from car to bicycle, we estimated that beneficial effects of increased physical activity are substantially larger (3--14 months gained) than the potential mortality effect of increased inhaled air pollution doses (0.8--40 days lost) and the increase in traffic accidents (5--9 days lost). Societal benefits are even larger because of a modest reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and traffic accidents. Conclusions On average, the estimated health benefits of cycling were substantially larger than the risks relative to car driving for individuals shifting their mode of transport.},

The program was designed to stimulate car-commuters to shift to e-bike in daily commuting, earning a monetary incentive for each kilometre e-cycled. With a longitudinal design, this study shows a significant increase in travel satisfaction when switching from car to e-bike. Starting from an average slightly positive satisfaction with car commuting, participants reported an extremely positive expected travel satisfaction by e-bike. Although a bit less than expected, the experienced travel satisfaction with e-cycling was high after a period of a month and even increased in the following period of half a year. Where the participants can be sub-divided into car-only and multi-modal car-commuters, this distinction does not show in the experienced travel satisfaction with e-cycling. Our study indicates that the hedonic treadmill mechanism does not automatically apply to the satisfaction with e-cycling. Multivariate analyses suggest that the increase in the travel satisfaction is affected by self-reported health, car ownership, urbanization degree, whether car use and ecycling are experienced as strenuous, congestion on the route and the attractiveness of the cycle route.},

  abstract = {In the wake of the growing popularity of pedestrian-oriented community designs, it is timely to assess potential risk trade-offs of such urban planning strategies. Pedestrian-friendly designs are currently being called for and implemented in the US to tackle in particular problems associated with insufficient physical activity in the population. Unintended consequences may emerge, however, especially due to potential increases in the inhalation of pollutants as the population walking or cycling in polluted environments increases. A risk assessment of such built environment transformations was undertaken to evaluate quantitatively the competing risks and benefits of community design changes in active travel. A simulation model, built incorporating research from the fields of transportation, environmental sciences and exposure analysis, is applied to a case study area that undergoes hypothetical urban transformations. We find that the simulated population experiences roughly the same number of days in a year with decreases as number of days with increases in energy expenditure or inhalation of pollutants. In the 5\% of days with greatest shifts, PM10 inhalation was shown to increase by 175\% or more, while the 5\% of days of greatest decreases exhibited reductions of 45\% or more (with similar results for ozone). Of particular concern, some individuals are shown to double their intake of the pollutants on high pollution days. However, uncertainty in the estimates is high. In particular, interpretations are very different according to the approach used to characterize year-long activity patterns. This innovative risk assessment uncovers critical gaps in the literature that must be further researched to allow essential comprehensive analyses of planning decisions.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability globally. Active transportation such as bicycling may increase physical activity levels. It is currently uncertain whether a shift from motorized transport modes to bicycle commuting leads to increased physical activity overall or substitutes other forms of physical activity. The study aims to disentangle whether bicycle commuting adds to or replaces other physical activities by comparing the physical activity performed by bicycle and motorized commuters. Methods: Physical activity, travel behavior, health status, sociodemographic, and built environment characteristics were assessed for 752 adults, between June 2011 and May 2012, in Barcelona, Spain. Statistical analyses, performed in 2013--2014, included linear, non-linear, and mixture models to estimate disparities and the dose--response relationship between physical activity duration and commute mode. Results: Regular bicycle commuters traveled by bicycle an average of 3.1 (SD{$\frac{1}{4}$}2.5) hours in the previous week. Bicycle commuting contributed positively to physical activity duration across participants (po0.05). It amounted to 2.1 (95\% CI{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.84, 3.55) hours/week extra of physical activity for bicycle commuters versus motorized commuters. Among bicycle travelers, there was a positive dose--response relationship between bicycle commuting and physical activity duration, with an average extra physical activity duration of 0.5 (95\% CI{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.4, 0.6) hours/week for every additional 1 hour/week of bicycle commuting. Conclusions: Bicycle commuting likely adds to overall physical activity. The extra physical activity performed by bicycle commuters is undertaken as moderate physical activity and follows a sigmoidal dose--response relationship with bicycle duration.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate methods of estimating the inhaled dose of air pollution and understand variability in the absence of a true gold standard metric. Five types of methods were identified: (1) methods using (physical) activity types, (2) methods based on energy expenditure, METs (metabolic equivalents of task), and oxygen consumption, (3) methods based on heart rate or (4) breathing rate, and (5) methods that combine heart and breathing rate. Methods were compared using a real-life data set of 122 adults who wore devices to track movement, black carbon air pollution, and physiological health markers for 3 weeks in three European cities. Different methods for estimating minute ventilation performed well in relative terms with high correlations among different methods, but in absolute terms, ignoring increased ventilation during day-to-day activities could lead to an underestimation of the daily dose by a factor of 0.08--1.78. There is no single best method, and a multitude of methods are currently being used to approximate the dose. The choice of a suitable method for determining the dose in future studies will depend on both the size and the objectives of the study.},

We construct fatality rates per distance traveled using official statistics and denominators from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. We model the life-table impact of switching from auto to bicycle commuting. Key factors are increased risks from road accidents and reduced risks from enhanced cardiovascular health. Results. Bicycling fatality rates in the U.S. are an order of magnitude higher than in Western Europe. Risks punish both young and old, while the health benefits guard against causes of mortality that rise rapidly with age. Although the protective effects of bicycling appear significant, it may be optimal to wait until later ages to initiate regular bicycle commuting in the current U.S. risk environment, especially if individuals discount future life years. Conclusions. The lifetime health benefits of bicycle commuting appear to outweigh the risks in the U.S., but individuals who sufficiently discount or disbelieve the health benefits may delay or avoid bicycling. Bicycling in middle age avoids much fatality risk while capturing health benefits. Significant cross-state variations in bicycling mortality suggest that improvements in the built environment might spur changes in transit mode.},

  abstract = {As part of the shift in policy to promote active travel, the UK's Manual for Streets (MfS) guidance proposed new approaches for priority intersections design in residential areas, promoting lower geometric visibilities for drivers on minor road arms to reduce collision severity, and the low-speed (i.e., 20 mph) limit zone policy. However, the relationship between speed, visibility, and collisions has not been explored comprehensively for these low-speed limit residential areas. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of shorter visibilities on vehicle-bicycle collisions at priority intersections in Portsmouth, UK. Using piecewise Structural Equations Modeling and Artificial Neural Network models, 120 locations in the city were analysed to understand the complex interplay between vehicles' speed, speed limits, visibilities, geometries, traffic flows, and collisions. The research question was whether shorter visibilities supported policy intentions by reducing bicycle collisions in low-speed limit areas, as MfS suggested. The results show that greater visibility 9 m back to left and right positively correlates with higher road traffic collisions. In comparison, greater left-hand visibility at 2.4 m back from minor arms has a counter-effect that improves safety. This supports the notion that shorter visibility in residential areas aid cyclist safety. This study contributes significantly to the literature by shedding light on the impact of shorter visibility on road safety. The findings have important implications for transportation policy and practice, highlighting the importance of the MfS approach for improving cyclist safety in the design of priority intersections.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews estimates of optimal speed limits made in the past 30 years. A tendency is seen for optimal speed limits to become higher. In the most recent estimates made for Norway, the optimal speed limit was in no case lower than 60 km/h. Adopting a speed limit of 60 km/h on roads in urban areas now having speed limits of 30, 40 or 50 km/h would most likely lead to an increase in the number of accidents and killed or injured road users. It is a political objective in Norway to reduce the number of killed or injured road users and to encourage more walking and cycling. Raising speed limits would conflict with both these objectives. This paper discusses if a re-interpretation of the notion of optimal speed limits can applied to justify low speed limits in urban areas. Traditionally, analyses of optimal speed limits have included motorised travel only. It is shown by means of simple numerical examples, that by including the effects of motorised travel speed on walking and cycling, optimal speed limits tend to be lower than when only motorised travel is included.},

  abstract = {Introduction Addressing walking and cycling commuters, this study aimed to measure personal exposure to traffic-related air pollution and analyze the associated health risks. Method Diffusive NO2-samplers were worn by 19 participants as they commuted to work in rush-hour traffic in May 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden (in total 336 trips, 197\,h). The average NO2-concentration per route was measured, and the health impacts were calculated based on previous epidemiological studies of the association between annual NO2-exposure and premature death. Result The measured average concentration per route ranged from 48 to 105 {$\mu$}gNO2/m3, and the average 67 {$\mu$}gNO2/m3 was more than five times higher than the urban background. This corresponded to an annual mean exposure of 16.4 {$\mu$}gNO2/m3, 40\% higher than the average exposure at other times. Thus, the increased risk for premature death was 3.3\%, with a range of 1.9\%--4.8\%, as related to assumptions regarding breathing rates and risk relationships between NO2-exposure and premature death. For active commuters in Stockholm in general, this indicated that one-fourth (23\%) of the annual inhaled dose of NO2 could be attributed to commuting, and that the risk for premature death increased by 2.5\% (1.4\%--3.7\%) due to air pollution. Note that these results were indicative rather than precise. These relationships may be applicable to active commuters in other cities. Conclusion The results indicated that active commuting in Stockholm is associated with significant exposure to traffic-related air pollution and that this increases the risk of premature death. It is recommended that future studies consider longer time periods to assess active commuters' personal exposure with higher precision. Policy implications include greater separation between active commuters and motor traffic, and promotion of behavioral changes in favor of emissions free vehicles and active modes of transport.},

  abstract = {To permit the assessment of risk factors in a unified framework while acknowledging characteristics specific to individual risk factors, the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) project initiated a systematic evaluation of the changes in population health that would result from modifying the population distribution of exposure to a risk factor or to a group of risk factors (Murray and others 2003; Murray and Lopez 1999; Ezzati and others 2004). In particular, the CRA framework compares the burden of disease due to the observed distribution of exposure in a population with the burden from an alternative distribution consistently defined across risk factors; considers multiple stages in the causal network of multiple risk factors and disease outcomes to allow inferences about combinations of risk factors for which epidemiological studies have not been conducted, including the joint effects of changes in multiple risk factors; converts the burden of disease and injury into a summary measure of population health that permits comparing fatal and nonfatal outcomes while also taking severity and duration into account (the summary measure used in this chapter is the disability-adjusted life year [DALY], whose definition and calculation are described in chapter 3). Therefore, even though CRA is similar to other risk assessment exercises in the sense that it applies knowledge about the hazardous effects of risk factors from epidemiological research to data on exposure in the broader population, it creates conceptual and methodological consistency in measuring the impacts of various risk factors on population health. Furthermore, we have attempted to use consistent and comparable criteria for evaluating the scientific evidence on prevalence, causality, and magnitude of hazardous effects across risk factors. As a result, the unified framework for describing population exposure to risk factors and their consequences for population health is an important step in linking the growing interest in the causal determinants of health across a variety of disciplines from natural, physical, and medical sciences to the social sciences and humanities.},

  abstract = {Fatal and Severe Injuries (FSI) to vulnerable road users is a major road safety problem internationally. Recent resolutions by the Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety called for a blanket 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas to address this problem. A project undertaken in Melbourne, Australia, set out to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of a lower speed limit in a local residential area in the City of Yarra. The intervention comprised replacing 40 km/h speed limit signs in the treated area with 30 km/h signs with an adjacent untreated control area. A before and after study was employed with speed, resident surveys, and estimated safety benefits as measures of its success. Modest reductions in mean speed were observed in the after-phase of the study while benefits were impressive for vehicles travelling at higher speed levels where the risk of severe injury or death is greater. These findings represent an estimated 4\% reduction in the risk of severe injury for pedestrians in the event of a collision. Questionnaire responses showed an increased degree of support for the 30 km/h speed limit in local streets in the trial area.

Lower speed limits in local streets and municipalities is one important measure to help address vulnerable road users in residential local streets.},

  abstract = {Background: Pedestrian related deaths have recently been on the rise in Canada. The effect of changing posted speeds on the frequency and severity of pedestrian motor vehicle collisions (PMVC) is not well studied using controlled quasi-experimental designs. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of lowering speed limits from 40 km/h to 30 km/h on PMVC on local roads in Toronto, Canada. Methods: A 30 km/h speed limit on local roads in Toronto was implemented between January 2015 and December 2016. Streets that remained at a 40 km/h speed limit throughout the study period were selected as comparators. A quasi-experimental, pre-post study with a comparator group was used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on PMVC rates before and after the speed limit change using repeated measures Poisson regression. PMVC data were obtained from police reports for a minimum of two years pre- and post-intervention (2013 to 2018). Results: Speed limit reductions from 40 km/h to 30 km/h were associated with a 28\% decrease in the PMVC incidence rate in the City of Toronto (IRR = 0.72, 95\% CI: 0.58--0.89). A non-significant 7\% decrease in PMVC incidence rates were observed on comparator streets that remained at 40 km/h speed limits (IRR = 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.70--1.25). Speed limit reduction also influenced injury severity, with a significant 67\% decrease in major and fatal injuries in the post intervention period on streets with speed limit reductions (IRR = 0.33, 95\% CI: 0.13--0.85) compared with a 31\% not statistically significant decrease in major and fatal injuries on comparator streets (IRR = 0.69, 95\% CI: 0.37--1.31). The interaction term for group and pre-post comparisons was not statistically significant (p = 0.14) indicating that there was no evidence to suggest a pre-post difference in IRRs between the intervention and comparator streets. Conclusions: Declines in the rate of PMVC were observed on roads with posted speed limit reductions from 40 km/h to 30 km/h, although this effect was not statistically greater than reductions on comparator streets.},

Methods Self-reported data based on the EQ-5D standardized measure of health status were collected from 29~770 participants in the Injury-VIBES injury cohort study, which covered Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. The data were combined to calculate new disability weights for each common injury classification and for each type of diagnosis covered by the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems. Weights were calculated separately for hospital admissions and presentations confined to emergency departments. Findings There were 29~770 injury cases with at least one EQ-5D score. The mean age of the participants providing data was 51 years. Most participants were male and almost a third had road traffic injuries. The new disability weights were higher for admitted cases than for cases confined to emergency departments and higher than the corresponding weights used by the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study. Long-term disability was common in most categories of injuries. Conclusion Injury is often a chronic disorder and burden of disease estimates should reflect this. Application of the new weights to burden studies would substantially increase estimates of disability-adjusted life-years and provide a more accurate reflection of the impact of injuries on peoples' lives.},

Some physical effort is required to activate the supporting engine, making it a potential active commuting option.         Purpose:~         We hypothesized that using an EAB in a hilly city allows sedentary subjects to commute comfortably, while providing a sufficient effort for health-enhancing purposes.         Methods:~         Sedentary subjects performed four different trips at a self-selected pace: walking 1.7 km uphill from the train station to the hospital (WALK), biking 5.1 km from the lower part of town to the hospital with a regular bike (BIKE), or EAB at two different power assistance settings (EABhigh, EABstd). HR, oxygen consumption, and need to shower were recorded.         Results:~         Eighteen sedentary subjects (12 female, 6 male) age 36 {\textpm} 10 yr were included, with V˙O2max of 39.4 {\textpm} 5.4 mL{$\cdot$}min-1{$\cdot$}kg-1. Time to complete the course was 22 (WALK), 19 (EABhigh), 21 (EABstd), and 30 (BIKE) min. Mean \%V˙O2max was 59.0\%, 54.9\%, 65.7\%, and 72.8\%. Mean \%HRmax was 71.5\%, 74.5\%, 80.3\%, and 84.0\%. There was no significant difference between WALK and EABhigh, but all other comparisons were different (P {$<$} 0.05). Two subjects needed to shower after EABhigh, 3 needed to shower after WALK, 8 needed to shower after EABstd, and all 18 needed to shower after BIKE. WALK and EABhigh elicited 6.5 and 6.1 METs (no difference), whereas it was 7.3 and 8.2 for EABstd and BIKE.         Conclusions:~         EAB is a comfortable and ecological transportation modality, helping sedentary people commute to work and meet physical activity guidelines. Subjects appreciated ease of use and mild effort needed to activate the engine support climbing hills, without the need to shower at work. EAB can be promoted in a challenging urban environment to promote physical activity and mitigate pollution issues.},

The objective of this study is to assess how costs of Portland's past and planned investments in bicycling relate to health and other benefits. Methods: Costs of investment plans are compared with 2 types of monetized health benefits, health care cost savings and value of statistical life savings. Levels of bicycling are estimated using past trends, future mode share goals, and a traffic demand model. Results: By 2040, investments in the range of \$138 to \$605 million will result in health care cost savings of \$388 to \$594 million, fuel savings of \$143 to \$218 million, and savings in value of statistical lives of \$7 to \$12 billion. The benefit-cost ratios for health care and fuel savings are between 3.8 and 1.2 to 1, and an order of magnitude larger when value of statistical lives is used. Conclusions: This first of its kind cost-benefit analysis of investments in bicycling in a US city shows that such efforts are cost-effective, even when only a limited selection of benefits is considered.},

HEAT has undergone regular upgrades adopting the latest scientific evidence. This article presents the most recent upgrades of the tool. The health impacts of walking and/or cycling in a specified population are quantified in terms of premature deaths avoided (or caused). In addition to the calculation of benefits derived from physical activity, HEAT was recently expanded to include assessments of the burden associated with air pollution exposure and crash risks while walking or cycling. Further, the impacts on carbon emissions from mode shifts to active travel modes can now be assessed. The monetization of impacts using Value of Statistical Life and Social Costs of Carbon now uses country-specific values. As active travel inherently results in often substantial health benefits as well as not always negligible risks, assessments of active travel behavior or policies are incomplete without considering health implications. The recent developments of HEAT make it easier than ever to obtain ballpark estimates of health impacts and carbon emissions related to walking and cycling.},

Dependency on car commuting also reduces physical fitness opportunities., Objective: In this study we sought to quantify benefits from reducing automobile usage for short urban and suburban trips., Methods: We simulated census-tract level changes in hourly pollutant concentrations from the elimination of automobile round trips {$\leq$} 8 km in 11 metropolitan areas in the upper midwestern United States using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Next, we estimated annual changes in health outcomes and monetary costs expected from pollution changes using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Benefits Mapping Analysis Program (BenMAP). In addition, we used the World Health Organization Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT) to calculate benefits of increased physical activity if 50\% of short trips were made by bicycle., Results: We estimate that, by eliminating these short automobile trips, annual average urban PM2.5 would decline by 0.1 {\textmu}g/m3 and that summer ozone (O3) would increase slightly in cities but decline regionally, resulting in net health bene-fits of \$4.94 billion/year [95\% confidence interval (CI): \$0.2 billion, \$13.5 billion), with 25\% of PM2.5 and most O3 bene-fits to populations outside metropolitan areas. Across the study region of approximately 31.3 million people and 37,000 total square miles, mortality would decline by approximately 1,295 deaths/year (95\% CI: 912, 1,636) because of improved air quality and increased exercise. Making 50\% of short trips by bicycle would yield savings of approximately \$3.8 billion/year from avoided mortality and reduced health care costs (95\% CI: \$2.7 billion, \$5.0 billion]. We estimate that the combined benefits of improved air quality and physical fitness would exceed \$8 billion/year., Conclusion: Our findings suggest that significant health and economic benefits are possible if bicycling replaces short car trips. Less dependence on automobiles in urban areas would also improve health in downwind rural settings.},

Using contemporaneous and historical data, new estimates are obtained using four revealed-preference techniques: the equal-sacrifice income tax approach, the Euler-equation approach, the Frisch additive-preferences approach and risk aversion in insurance markets. A meta-analysis indicates parameter homogeneity across approaches, and a central estimate of 1.5 for {$\eta$}. The confidence interval excludes unity, the value used in official guidance by the UK government. The term structure of the SDR is then estimated. The result is a short-run SDR of 4.5\% declining to 4.2\% in the very long-run. This is higher and flatter than the UK official guidance. The difference stems from incorrect calibration of social welfare and estimation of the diffusion of growth. Other things equal, the results suggest that current UK guidance might need to be updated.},

The paper first evaluates the actual use of bikes in the city, and then considers why and how much such an active mobility style can be expanded. Two models are used to compare the outcome of cycling on the specific population sample with the equivalent path travelled by car. The first model computes the long term effects of the physical activity, and the second evaluates the exacerbation of some relevant diseases due to the exposure to high levels of pollutants, in the case at hand, mainly particulate matter with diameter smaller than 10 {\textmu}m (PM10). According to these two models, the overall balance for public health is always in favour of systematic biking. Even the current level of biking, low in comparison to other European cities, allows a considerable economic advantage on the order of tens of millions euros per year. This may increase to hundreds of millions if the biking level of more bike-friendly cities is reached. Despite being much less relevant from the economic viewpoint, the study also estimates the reduction of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the assumed biking levels.},

Methods: Eighty non-smoking participants aged 16--21 years underwent incremental tests using a bicycle ergometer, where the HR and minute VE were measured simultaneously. Linear mixed models were constructed with data obtained from a CPET. Ten individuals were chosen randomly as the external validation group. The predictive performance was assessed using an eight-fold cross-validation procedure. Air pollution concentration was monitored during the CPET and the inhaled load was calculated. Results: The overall estimation of the intercept and slope for all participants was 0.585 {\textpm} 0.013 and 0.007 {\textpm} 0.00002, respectively. The overall fitted R squared (R2) was 0.84. The median difference between the measured VE and the predicted VE was 0.3 L/min, and the difference between the inhaled load based on the fitted VE and the measured VE was 0.0--0.3 {$\mu$}g across all the participants. The eight folds cross-validation R2 value was 0.78, suggesting high predictive accuracy. Conclusion: This is the first study to derive a novel equation for the relationship between HR and VE in a young Chinese population and verify its external validity. This will be important in the assessment of the inhaled load in future epidemiology studies. However, inter-individual variations should also be considered when VE is estimated at an individual level.},

  abstract = {In burden of disease studies, several approaches are used to assess disability weights, a scaling factor necessary to compute years lived with disability (YLD). The aim of this study was to quantify disability weights for injury consequences with two competing approaches, (a) standard QALY/DALY model (SQM) which derives disability weights from patient survey data and (b) the annual profile model (APM) which derives weights for the same patient data valued by a panel. Disability weights were assessed using (a) EQ-5D data from a postal survey among 8,564 injury patients 2(1/2), 5, and 9 months after attending the Emergency Department, and (b) preferences of 143 laymen elicited with the time trade-off method. Compared with APM, SQM disability weights were consistently higher. YLD calculated with SQM disability weights was more than three times higher compared with YLD calculated with APM disability weights, for mild injuries with short duration, this increase was six fold. The APM seems the preferred method in burden of injury studies that includes mild conditions with a rapid course, since the SQM approach might overestimate the impact of the latter. The APM, however, might underestimate the impact of injury consequences, especially in case of severe injuries.},

Methods The method developed consists of obtaining data on injury cases seen in emergency departments as well as injury-related hospital admissions, using the EUROCOST system to link the injury cases to disability information and employing empirical data to describe functional outcomes in injured patients. Findings Overall, 87 weights and proportions for 27 injury diagnoses involving lifelong consequences were included in the method. Almost all of the injuries investigated (96--100\%) could be assigned to EUROCOST categories. The mean number of YLD per case of injury varied with the country studied. Use of the novel method resulted in estimated burdens of injury that were 3 to 8 times higher, in terms of YLD, than the corresponding estimates produced using the conventional methods employed in global burden of disease studies, which employ disability-adjusted life years. Conclusion The novel method for calculating YLD after injury can be applied in different settings, overcomes some limitations of the method used to calculate the global burden of disease, and allows more accurate estimates of the population burden of injury.},

  abstract = {Although many patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly mild TBI, recover from their symptoms within a few weeks, a small but meaningful subset experience symptoms that persist for months or years after injury and significantly impact quality of life for the person and their family. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of negative TBI outcomes include not only characteristics of the injury and injury mechanism, but also the person's age, pre-injury status, comorbid conditions, environment, and propensity for resilience. In this article, as part of the Brain Trauma Blueprint: TBI State of the Science framework, we examine the epidemiology of long-term outcomes of TBI, including incidence, prevalence, and risk factors. We identify the need for increased longitudinal, global, standardized, and validated assessments on incidence, recovery, and treatments, as well as standardized assessments of the influence of genetics, race, ethnicity, sex, and environment on TBI outcomes. By identifying how epidemiological factors contribute to TBI outcomes in different groups of persons and potentially impact differential disease progression, we can guide investigators and clinicians toward more-precise patient diagnosis, along with tailored management, and improve clinical trial designs, data evaluation, and patient selection criteria.},

In this study we examined, for the first time, the acute physiological impact of electrical support during outdoor cycling in CAD patients (ISRCTN32238279).Methods: Fifteen CAD patients (13 males), aged 64 {\textpm} 7 years executed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and afterwards cycled a predefined outdoor route of 10 km, in three different conditions: classical cycling (no support), EAB with low support (EABlow) and high support (EABhigh). Oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) was measured continuously by a portable gas-analysing system. Cycling time was recorded and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed at 3 and 7 km.Results: Mean VO2 during EABhigh (1721 {\textpm} 537 ml{$\bullet$}min-1) was significantly lower compared to EABlow (1890 {\textpm} 619 ml{$\bullet$}min-1, p {$<$} .05), but no differences were found between EABlow and classical cycling (1846 {\textpm} 523 ml{$\bullet$}min--1). EABlow and EABhigh elicited a sufficient volume and intensity (6.6 {\textpm} 2.0 MET's (74 {\textpm} 6\% VO2peak) and 6.0 {\textpm} 1.8 MET's (68 {\textpm} 7\% VO2peak), respectively) to adhere to the guidelines for secondary prevention in CAD. RPE was significantly lower p {$<$} .05) during EABhigh (9 {\textpm} 2), than during EABlow (11 {\textpm} 2) or classical cycling (11 {\textpm} 2).Conclusions: Outdoor cycling with electrical support leads to a sufficiently high exercise intensity and volume in CAD patients, and may be considered as an alternative exercise modality.},

For this reason, we investigated self-reported leisure time physical activities in relation to fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular disease incidence.The Dutch Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases Study, carried out between 1993 and 1997, is a prospective cohort study of over 23000 men and women aged 20--65 years from the general Dutch population.From 1994 till 1997 physical activity was assessed with a questionnaire in 7451 men and 8991 women who were followed for an average of 9.8 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used adjusting for age, sex, other physical activities, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational level.Almost the entire study population (97\%) was engaged in walking, about 75\% in regular cycling, and about half the population in sports or gardening. Cycling [hazard ratio (HR): 0.82, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.71--0.95] and sports (HR: 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.64--0.87) were both inversely related to cardiovascular disease incidence, whereas walking and gardening were not. For sports (P\,\&lt;\,0.001), but not for cycling (P\,=\,0.06), we found a dose\,-\,response relationship with respect to cardiovascular disease incidence. Engaging in both cycling and sports resulted in an even greater risk reduction (HR: 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.52--0.77).In this relatively active population, types of activities of at least moderate intensity, such as cycling and sports were associated with lower CVD incidence, whereas activities of lower intensity, such as walking and gardening, were not.},

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the beliefs of individuals using e-bikes for active transport and report preliminary biometric measurements while using e-bikes for physical activity compared with conventional bikes. Methods: Participants used both conventional bicycles and e-bikes to compare energy expenditure while riding on the study route. Apple smart watches were used to track each participant's heart rate, distance, speed, and time while riding both bicycles. A total of 3 survey instruments were used to estimate beliefs: one administered before riding the bicycles, a second administered after riding a conventional bike, and the final survey completed after riding an e-bike. Survey instruments were constructed using constructs from the theory of planned behavior. Results: The study sample (N=33) included adults aged between 19 and 28 years. Paired t test analysis revealed that participants believed a conventional bike was more likely than an e-bike to benefit their physical health (P=.002) and save them money (P=.005), while an e-bike was perceived to be more likely than a conventional bike to save them time (P{$<$}.001). Paired t test analysis revealed participants significantly agreed more with the statement that they could ride an e-bike most days (P=.006) compared with a conventional bike. After participants traveled approximately 10 miles on each type of bicycle, participants' mean average heart rate while riding the e-bike was 6.21 beats per minute lower than when riding the conventional bike (P=.04), but both were significantly higher than resting heart rate (P{$<$}.001). Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that e-bikes are an active form of transportation capable of providing much of the cardiovascular health benefits obtained during conventional bike use. E-bikes may help reduce some of the obstacles to conventional bike use, such as increased transportation time, decreased convenience, and physical fatigue.},

Results Obtainment of the proposed increase in cycling could reduce the burden of disease in the study population by 19.5 DALY annually.

Methods--- We used the person trade-off procedure developed by the World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease Project (WHO-GBDP) to generate disability weights (DWs) ranging from 0 (normal) to 1 (dead) for each of 7 mRS grades. The ratings of an international, 9-member panel of stroke experts were combined by a modified Delphi process. Results--- DWs (95\% CI) were 0 for mRS 0, 0.046 (0.004 to 0.088) for mRS 1, 0.212 (0.175 to 0.250) for mRS 2, 0.331 (0.292 to 0.371) for mRS 3, 0.652 (0.625 to 0.678) for mRS 4, 0.944 (0.873 to 1.015) for mRS 5, and 1.0 for mRS 6. DWs of adjacent mRS levels were significantly different (P{$<$}0.001 for all). Coefficients of variation showed a high degree of consensus for DWs among panel members. DWs placed each of the 5 intermediate mRS states in different disability class levels of the WHO-GBDP anchor conditions and identified natural clusters to use when reducing the mRS to fewer categories. Conclusions--- Formal DW assignment confirms that the mRS is an ordered but unequally spaced scale. The availability of DWs for each mRS level now permits direct comparison of each poststroke outcome state with the outcomes of hundreds of other diseases in the WHO-GBDP and the expression of stroke burden in different populations by using the uniform metric of disability-adjusted life-years lost.},

  abstract = {Background: Pedestrians struck in motorised vehicle crashes constitute the largest group of traffic fatalities worldwide. Excessive speed is the primary contributory factor in such crashes. The relationship between estimated impact speed and the risk of a pedestrian fatality has generated much debate concerning what should be a safe maximum speed limit for vehicles in high pedestrian active areas. Methods: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, COMPENDEX, and SCOPUS) were searched to identify relevant studies. Records were assessed, and data retrieved independently by two authors in adherence with the PRISMA statement. The included studies reported data on pedestrian fatalities from motorised vehicle crashes with known estimated impact speed. Summary odds ratios (OR) were obtained using meta-regression models. Time trends and publication bias were assessed. Results: Fifty-five studies were identified for a full-text assessment, 27 met inclusion criteria, and 20 were included in a meta-analysis. The analyses found that when the estimated impact speed increases by 1 km/h, the odds of a pedestrian fatality increases on average by 11\% (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.10--1.12). The risk of a fatality reaches 5\% at an estimated impact speed of 30 km/h, 10\% at 37 km/h, 50\% at 59 km/h, 75\% at 69 km/h and 90\% at 80 km/h. Evidence of publication bias and time trend bias among included studies were found. Conclusions: The results of the meta-analysis support setting speed limits of 30--40 km/h for high pedestrian active areas. These speed limits are commonly used by best practice countries that have the lowest road fatality rates and that practice a Safe System Approach to road safety.},

  abstract = {Large-scale analyses on the travel behavior of e-bikes are scarce, and current knowledge regarding who the e-bike owners are is inconsistent. Also, commuters represent a relevant user group with an unexploited potential. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine (i) associations between type of bike (e-bike vs. regular bike) with place of residence (county), sociodemographic variables (age, sex, educational level, income and ethnicity) and habitual physical activity level, and (ii) if public employees possessing an e-bike cycle more often and longer distances to work. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 among 1977 (5.2\% of eligible subjects) public employees in Southern and Western Norway. Binary and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted. Respondents possessing an e-bike were less likely to perform high levels of leisure time physical activity (OR 0.56 (CI 0.39-0.82)), compared to those possessing a regular bike only. For those residing in Agder, the likelihood of possessing an e-bike (vs. regular bike) was almost 4 times higher (OR 3.98 (CI 2.53-6.26)), compared with participants residing in Sogn og Fjordane. Compared with those possessing a regular bike only, e-bike users cycled more frequently to work, both occasionally (OR 3.71 (CI 2.44-5.65)) and most of the time (OR 4.28 (CI 2.79-6.55)), and they had higher odds of cycling medium distances to the workplace (OR 1.74 (CI 1.04-2.90)). In conclusion, e-bike access could result in increased commuter cycling, both in terms of cycling frequency and cycling distance, which in turn could contribute to enhanced physical activity levels.},

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a process that can be used to evaluate health effects of transportation policy. We present a rapid HIA, conducted over eight weeks, evaluating health and economic effects of proposed fare increases and service cuts to Boston, Massachusetts' public transportation system. We used transportation modeling in concert with tools allowing for quantification and monetization of multiple pathways. We estimated health and economic costs of proposed public transportation system changes to be hundreds of millions of dollars per year, exceeding the budget gap the public transportation authority was required to close. Significant health pathways included crashes, air pollution, and physical activity. The HIA enabled stakeholders to advocate for more modest fare increases and service cuts, which were eventually adopted by decision makers. This HIA was among the first to quantify and monetize multiple pathways linking transportation decisions with health and economic outcomes, using approaches that could be applied in different settings. Including health costs in transportation decisions can lead to policy choices with both economic and public health benefits.},

We estimated the potential effect of increased walking and cycling in urban England and Wales on costs to the National Health Service (NHS) for seven diseases - namely, type 2 diabetes, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, and ischaemic heart disease - that are associated with physical inactivity. Within 20 years, reductions in the prevalences of type 2 diabetes, dementia, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer because of increased physical activity would lead to savings of roughly UK{\pounds}17 billion (in 2010 prices) for the NHS, after adjustment for an increased risk of road traffic injuries. Further costs would be averted after 20 years. Sensitivity analyses show that results are invariably positive but sensitive to assumptions about time lag between the increase in active travel and changes in health outcomes. Increasing the amount of walking and cycling in urban settings could reduce costs to the NHS, permitting decreased government expenditure on health or releasing resources to fund additional health care. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whereas market data is available describing sales trends, there is limited understanding of the experience of early adopters of e-bike technology. This paper investigates the motives for e-bike purchase, rider experience and perceived impact on mobility, health and wellbeing through in-depth interviews with e-bike owners in the Netherlands and the UK. Findings revealed that the motive for purchasing e-bikes was often to allow maintenance of cycling against a backdrop of changing individual or household circumstances. E-bikes also provided new opportunities for people who would not otherwise consider conventional cycling. Perceptions of travel behaviour change revealed that e-biking was replacing conventional cycling but was also replacing journeys that would have been made by car. There was also a perception that e-biking has increased, or at least allowed participants to maintain, some form of physical activity and had benefitted personal wellbeing. Technological, social and environmental barriers to e-biking were identified. These included weight of bicycle, battery life, purchase price, social stigma and limitations of cycle infrastructure provision. Additional research is necessary to quantify actual levels of mode substitution and new journey generation among new e-bike owners and the impact of e-biking on promoting physical health and mental wellbeing.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Walking and cycling have shown beneficial effects on population risk of all-cause mortality (ACM). This paper aims to review the evidence and quantify these effects, adjusted for other physical activity (PA). Data sources: We conducted a systematic review to identify relevant studies. Searches were conducted in November 2013 using the following health databases of publications: Embase (OvidSP); Medline (OvidSP); Web of Knowledge; CINAHL; SCOPUS; SPORTDiscus. We also searched reference lists of relevant texts and reviews. Study eligibility criteria and participants: Eligible studies were prospective cohort design and reporting walking or cycling exposure and mortality as an outcome. Only cohorts of individuals healthy at baseline were considered eligible. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Extracted data included study population and location, sample size, population characteristics (age and sex), follow-up in years, walking or cycling exposure, mortality outcome, and adjustment for other co-variables. We used random-effects meta-analyses to investigate the beneficial effects of regular walking and cycling. Results: Walking (18 results from 14 studies) and cycling (8 results from 7 studies) were shown to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, adjusted for other PA. For a standardised dose of 11.25 MET.hours per week (or 675 MET. minutes per week), the reduction in risk for ACM was 11\% (95\% CI = 4 to 17\%) for walking and 10\% (95\% CI = 6 to 13\%) for cycling. The estimates for walking are based on 280,000 participants and 2.6 million person-years and for cycling they are based on 187,000 individuals and 2.1 million person-years. The shape of the dose--response relationship was modelled through meta-analysis of pooled relative risks within three exposure intervals. The dose--response analysis showed that walking or cycling had the greatest effect on risk for ACM in the first (lowest) exposure interval. Conclusions and implications: The analysis shows that walking and cycling have population-level health benefits even after adjustment for other PA. Public health approaches would have the biggest impact if they are able to increase walking and cycling levels in the groups that have the lowest levels of these activities.

  abstract = {Objectives To conduct a health economic evaluation of a proposed investment in urban bicycle infrastructure in Stockholm County, Sweden. Design A cost-effectiveness analysis is undertaken from a healthcare perspective. Investment costs over a 50-year life cycle are offset by averted healthcare costs and compared with estimated long-term impacts on morbidity, quantified in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The results are re-calculated under different assumptions to model the effects of uncertainty. Setting The Municipality of Stockholm (population 2.27 million) committed funds for bicycle path infrastructure with the aim of achieving a 15\% increase in the number of bicycle commuters by 2030. This work is based on a previously constructed scenario, in which individual registry data on home and work address and a transport model allocation to different modes of transport identified 111 487 individuals with the physical capacity to bicycle to work within 30 min but that currently drive a car to work. Results Morbidity impacts and healthcare costs attributed to increased physical activity, change in air pollution exposure and accident risk are quantified under the scenario. The largest reduction in healthcare costs is attributed to increased physical activity and the second largest to reduced air pollution exposure among the population of Greater Stockholm. The expected net benefit from the investment is 8.7\% of the 2017 Stockholm County healthcare budget, and 3.7\% after discounting. The economic evaluation estimates that the intervention is cost-effective and each DALY averted gives a surplus of {\texteuro}9933. The results remained robust under varied assumptions pertaining to reduced numbers of additional bicycle commuters. Conclusion Investing in urban infrastructure to increase bicycling as active transport is cost-effective from a healthcare sector perspective.},

Speed measurements have been performed at accident sites, and the results show that there was a relationship between the (1) mean travel speed and (2) the age of the pedestrian struck and the injury severity and risk of fatality. The data also shows that even though fatal accidents (excluding run-over accidents) are rare in speed environments where the mean travel speed is below 40 km/h and severe injuries are rare below 25 km/h, over 30\% of severe injury accidents occur in speed environments below 35 km/h. This indicates that 30 km/h speed limits might not be as safe as previously believed. The current speed policy needs to address this issue.

  abstract = {This paper presents a study on physical activity implications of electric bikes, focusing on the users of an on-campus conventional bicycle and e-bike sharing system at the University of Tennessee. The study describes field trials of 17 users of the bikesharing system and investigates physical activity metrics on identical trips made by three different modes: walk, conventional bicycle, and pedal-assist electric bicycle. The users completed a hilly 4.43 kilometer route using each mode. Heart rate and human power output were monitored along with GPS for each bout. In addition, the study used a laboratory test to relate oxygen consumption rate (VO2 in ml/kg/min) and energy expenditure (EE kcal/kg/min) to user heart rate during bouts. Energy expenditure and ventilation rates (per minute) for all modes were not statistically different. However, total EE and VO2 for each bout (per mile) for e-bikes are 24\% lower than that for conventional bicycles, and 64\% lower than for walking. This reflects the shorter travel time. Differences between e-bikes and bicycles are most pronounced on the uphill segment. Still, e-bikes provide moderate physical activity (MET{$>$}3) on flat segments and downhill segments, and vigorous physical activity (MET{$>$}6) on uphill segments. For e-bike trials, riders reported higher levels of enjoyment and lower need for a shower than walk or conventional bicycle trials. This paper adds to the expanding literature by comparing e-bike, bicycle and walk EE and VO2. E-bikes can contribute as an active transportation mode to meet required physical activity guidelines.},

  abstract = {Background: A significant reduction in road traffic accidents has been observed since prevention measures were introduced by the French public authorities in 2002. The goals of this study are to describe the burden of road traffic accidents in a French Departement, and to identify changes if any between the periods 1997-2001 and 2002-2006 on the basis of the disability adjusted life years (DALY). Methods: Years of lost life (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) were calculated for two periods using the mortality and incidence data in the Rhone Departement Registry of Road Traffic Accident Casualties. Results: YLD and YLL that are related to road traffic accidents are at their maximum value between 15 and 24 years of age. For men, intracranial fractures and intracranial injuries dominate, and for women it is spinal cord injuries that account for highest rates of YLD. A reduction in the rates of YLL and YLD has been observed for both genders and all age groups between 1997-2001 and 2002-2006. Conclusion: The reduction in DALY between the two periods is explained both by the reduction in the number of fatalities and injuries but also by an increase in the age at which they occur.},

While the equations are clear, the logic behind them is opaque at best for a large share of public health practitioners and students. The objective of this paper is to show how to calculate DALYs using a discrete time formulation that is easy to teach to students and public health practitioners, is easy to apply for those with basic discounting skills, and is consistent with the discounting methods typically included on the costing side of cost-effectiveness analysis. A continuous-time adjustment factor is derived that can be used to ensure exact consistency between the continuous and discrete time approaches, but this level of precision is typically unnecessary for cost-effectiveness analyses. To illustrate the approach, both a new, simple example and the same example presented in Fox-Rushby and Hanson are used throughout the paper.},

The electrically assisted bicycle may help individuals achieve the ACSM's aerobic recommendations and introduce inactive individuals to physical activity. To compare the physiological requirements of riding a bicycle with electric pedal assist versus non-assist among healthy active young adults. 6 males and 6 females completed two randomized cycling trials using electric pedal assist (PAB) and non-assist (NON). Cycling trials were completed over a 3.54 km course with varying terrain. Time to completion was faster in the PAB (12.5 {\textpm} 0.3 min) than the NON (13.8 {\textpm} 0.3 min, p=0.01). Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was lower in the PAB (12.0 {\textpm} 0.4) than the NON (14.8 {\textpm} 0.5, p {$<$} 0.001). There was no difference in mean VO2 between PAB (2.3 {\textpm} 0.1 L{$\cdot$}min-1) and NON (2.5 {\textpm} 0.1 L{$\cdot$}min-1, p=0.45). There was no difference in mean power output when comparing PAB (115 {\textpm} 11 Watts) to NON (128 {\textpm} 11 Watts, p=0.38). There was no difference in heart rate between PAB (147 {\textpm} 5 bpm) and NON (149 {\textpm} 5 bpm, p=0.77). Recreationally active younger (college age) individuals may self-select a similar physiological intensity of physical activity regardless of mechanical assistance, resulting in quicker completion of a commuting task with PAB. Both the PAB and NON exercise bouts met ACSM criteria for vigorous exercise.},

Method: Existing data sources were used to model effects, in the urban setting in New Zealand, of varying the proportion of vehicle kilometres travelled by bicycle instead of light motor vehicle. Results: Shifting 5\% of vehicle kilometres to cycling would reduce vehicle travel by approximately 223 million kilometres each year, save about 22 million litres of fuel and reduce transport-related greenhouse emissions by 0.4\%. The health effects would include about 116 deaths avoided annually as a result of increased physical activity, six fewer deaths due to local air pollution from vehicle emissions, and an additional five cyclist fatalities from road crashes. In economic terms, including only fatalities and using the NZ Ministry of Transport Value of a Statistical Life, the health effects of a 5\% shift represent net savings of about \$200 million per year. Conclusion: The health benefits of moving from cars to bikes heavily outweigh the costs of injury from road crashes. Implications: Transport policies that encourage bicycle use will help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse emissions and improve public health.},

Design~         Twenty participants (ten trained vs. ten untrained in endurance) novice in the electrically assisted bicycle performed the same cycling protocol composed of nine 5-min submaximal cycling periods without electrical support (NO), with a light support (S1), or with a high support (S4). The cycling conditions were tested at two different imposed speeds (16 and 21 km{$\cdot$}hr-1) and one freely chosen speed (mean [SD], 18.1 [0.7] km{$\cdot$}h-1).         Results~         Mean power output, intensity, and energy expenditure were significantly lowered by the use of an electrical support, in similar proportions between the groups. For all subjects, the intensity of the electrically assisted bicycle in all measured conditions (S1 or S4) was sufficiently high to achieve the standards for moderate-intensity health-enhancing physical activity for adults ({$>$}3 metabolic equivalents). However, a vigorous intensity ({$>$}6 metabolic equivalents) was reached with the NO and S1 supports in the untrained group whatever the cycling speed and only at 21 km{$\cdot$}hr-1 with the light support (S1) in the endurance-trained group.         Conclusions~         By reducing the perceived sensation of effort while maintaining a sufficiently high energy expenditure, the electrically assisted bicycle has a great potential to promote physical activity in industrialized societies.},

  abstract = {As crash speed increases, so does the probability of injury. The vulnerability of different road users varies greatly, in part due to differences in their protective equipment. Therefore, for the same speed, their injury probabilities are different. The objective of this study is to define injury risk curves, mathematical relations between closing speed (the relative speed between two crash partners) and injury outcome, for different road users. These risk curves can be used to rank road user vulnerability and define safe speeds, i.e. speeds not exceeding tolerable injury probabilities. Crashes involving pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, and car drivers impacting the front of another passenger car (i.e. frontal impacts from the other car's perspective) were extracted from the German in-depth accident study (GIDAS). The injuries were modelled as a function of closing speed and road user age using a weighted binary logistic regression. In accordance with the Abbreviated Injury Scale 2015 revision, three injury severities were modelled: at-least-moderate injury severities, at-least-serious injury severities, and fatal injuries. The constructed risk curves predicted injury outcomes with an average Area under the Curve ranging from 0.66 to 0.94 in cross-validation. A 10\% risk of sustaining at-least-serious injuries corresponds to a closing speed of 29 km/h for pedestrians, 44 km/h for cyclists, 48 km/h for motorcyclists, and 112 km/h for car drivers. If a 10\% risk of serious injury is acceptable, the closing speeds can be translated into safe speed limits of 25 km/h for cars with pedestrian encounters; 20 to 25 km/h for cyclists, motorcyclists, and cars when they encounter each other; and 55 km/h for cars in head-on impacts. These safe speeds align with current speed limits of 20 to 30 km/h in urban centers but bring into question the current practices of much higher speed limits on rural roads shared by bicycles, motorcycles, and cars. However, safe speed limits could be increased (maintaining a 10\% serious injury risk) if road users have more protective equipment and Automated Emergency Braking reliably reduces impact speeds in all crash types.},

Statistics on travel patterns and injuries, physical activity, fine particulate matter, and GHGE in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, were input to a model that calculated the health impacts of walking and bicycling short distances usually traveled by car or driving low-emission automobiles. We measured the change in disease burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) based on dose--response relationships and the distributions of physical activity, particulate matter, and traffic injuries. Results: Increasing median daily walking and bicycling from 4 to 22 minutes reduced the burden of cardiovascular disease and diabetes by 14\% (32\,466 DALYs), increased the traffic injury burden by 39\% (5907 DALYS), and decreased GHGE by 14\%. Low-carbon driving reduced GHGE by 33.5\% and cardiorespiratory disease burden by less than 1\%. Conclusions: Increased physical activity associated with active transport could generate a large net improvement in population health. Measures would be needed to minimize pedestrian and bicyclist injuries. Together, active transport and low-carbon driving could achieve GHGE reductions sufficient for California to meet legislative mandates.},

US pedestrian data was drawn from the Pedestrian Crash Data Study (PCDS). European pedestrian data was drawn from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS). Results were analyzed in terms of both serious injury (AIS 3+) and disabling injury estimated with the Functional Capacity Index (FCI). The results are presented in parallel for a more complete international perspective on injuries and injury sources. Lower extremity injury from bumper impact and head\&face injury from windshield impact were the most frequent combinations for both serious and disabling injuries. Serious lower extremity injuries from bumper contact occurred in 43\% of seriously injured pedestrian cases in US PCDS data and 35\% of European GIDAS cases. Lower-extremity bumper injuries also account for more than 20\% of disability in both datasets. Serious head \&face injuries from windshield contact occur in 27\% of PCDS and 15\% of GIDAS serious injury cases. While bumper impacts primarily result in lower extremity injury and windshield impacts are most often associated with head \& face injuries, the hood and hood leading edge are responsible for serious and disabling injuries to a number of different body regions. Therefore, while it is appropriate to focus on lower extremity injury when studying bumper performance and on head injury risk when studying windshield impact, pedestrian performance of other components may require better understanding of injury risk for multiple body regions.},

Injury patterns were identified using the Rh{\^o}ne Road Trauma Registry which covers all the casualties resulting from crashes in the Rh{\^o}ne D{\'e}partement (1.6 million inhabitants) who seek medical care in health facilities. Fatality rates were estimated from national police reports for the same years (1996--2007), and the two data sources were linked to obtain information on the front profile of the striking car. As with all groups of road users, most of the pedestrians involved in car crashes were young. However elderly people were overrepresented when the size of the exposed population was taken into account. The most frequently injured body regions were the lower extremities (50\% of victims), the head/face/neck (38\%) and the upper extremities (27\%). Pelvic injuries were much more common for women. The most severe injuries (AIS4+) were mostly to the head and thorax, for all groups of road users. However, pedestrians sustained twice as many head injuries as thoracic injuries. When the front profiles were grouped together according to the most common car types in Europe, the risk of being killed was higher for MPVs. More specifically, the risk of sustaining an AIS2+ thoracic injury was higher in a collision with an MPV. Our study confirms that it is quite justified for the tests based on European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee guidelines to be focused on the head and the lower extremities. However, no test procedure exists for thoracic injuries, which is the body region with the second highest number of severe or fatal injuries.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that physical training causes a slower, deeper breathing pattern at a given level ofventilation, but there is no convincing evidence to support this. We examined breathing pattern during maximal incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer in 7 males before and after 3-4 weeks of cycle endurance training (TRAINING), and in 6 males before and after a similar period of unaltered physical activity (CONTROL); all subjects were healthy and previously sedentary. After physical training there was a significant increase in peak.oxygen uptake, and significant reductions in carbon dioxide output, heart rate (fHR) and minute ventilation (V0 at submaximal workloads; peak {\textasciitilde}/l was significantly increased whereas peak fHR was unchanged. At matched {\textasciitilde}'I levels (moderate, moderately-high, high) the TRAINING subjects' breathing pattern was not significantly altered; there was a power of at least 80\% to detect a significant ({$>$} 0.30 L) increase in tidal volume (P{$<$}0.05) at moderately high and high ventilation levels. There was no change in the CONTROL subjects' maximal exercise performance, or breathing pattern at matched {\textasciitilde}tl levels, over the same period. Short-term, activity-specific physical training does not significantly affect the breathing pattern adopted by normal humans during progressive exercise.},

  abstract = {Introduction This study aims to quantify, in monetary terms, the health benefits associated with a shift from private cars and motorbikes to active mobility modes in Italy and at providing unit benefit factors to be used in policy making. Modes considered are walking, bikes and e-bikes. Methods The quantification is carried out through the development of a mobility-change, ten-year scenario for some Italian cities. The positive effect of increased physical activity levels as well as the negative effects of increased air pollutant intake and road injury risk by active mobility adopters are considered. Health impacts are measured through the change in expected mortality. City-specific mortality rates, demographic structure and the underlying physical activity levels of the population are considered. Changes in mortality rates are translated in monetary units using the value of a life year (VOLY) and the value of a statistical life (VSL). Unit benefit factors expressed in euro/km are derived from total benefits and distance travelled. Results Average benefits associated with increased physical activity outweight damages associated with increased air pollutant intake and road injury risk for all active mobility modes considered. The average overall benefit, however, differs substantially across modes. It is as high as 0.32 euro/km in the case of walking but much lower for bikes (0.06 euro/km) and e-bikes (0.02 euro/km) because of different physical efforts, effort duration and ventilation rates. In cities with high air pollutant background concentrations, e-bike overall benefit can dip to zero. Conclusions This is the first work using the VOLY for the monetization of health benefits and including e-bikes among active mobility modes. It also considers the demographic structure and underlying physical activiy levels of the population. The main limitation is that impacts only consider changes in mortality and not in morbidity.},

This study assesses, under an economic point of view, the health benefits of a shift from private cars to active mobility for urban travels in Italy, considering both mortality and morbidity effects. The overall health effect is the result of positive (increased physical activity) and negative effects (increased air pollutant intake and increased road injury risk). Health impacts are measured using disability-adjusted life years and translated into monetary terms using either the value of a life year or the value of a statistical life. On average, the overall health effect of the modal shift is negative. This is largely due to the very high pedestrian and bike road injury rates in Italian cities. The negative effect of increased air pollution intake is negligible if compared with the effect of road injuries. In the case of bikes/e-bikes, the overall health effect is positive in cities characterised by good cycling infrastructure.},

In this Dutch case-study we used a computer simulation approach to answer the following questions: Which anti-tobacco intervention has the largest health gain? Will a commuter cycling policy result in any substantial health gain? What is the relative health gain of promoting higher consumption of vegetables and fruit? We concluded that substantial health gain can be achieved if cigarette packet price were to increase by 2 Dutch guilders. A commitment of all general practitioners to implement a smoking cessation intervention will result in a similar health gain. Stimulating commuter cycling could be a promising example of intersectoral health policy. Interventions to promote higher vegetable and fruit consumption will result in a relatively small health gain. Pros and cons of simulation models to support intersectoral health policy are discussed. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, risks of injury from exposure to motorized traffic and their emissions (i.e. air pollution) exist. The objective was to systematically review studies conducting health impact assessment (HIA) of a mode shift to AT on grounds of associated health benefits and risks. Methods. Systematic database searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science and Transportation Research International Documentation were performed by two independent researchers, augmented by bibliographic review, internet searches and expert consultation to identify peer-reviewed studies from inception to December 2014. Results. Thirty studies were included, originating predominantly from Europe, but also the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They compromised of mostly HIA approaches of comparative risk assessment and cost--benefit analysis. Estimated health benefit--risk or benefit--cost ratios of a mode shift to AT ranged between -2 and 360 (median = 9). Effects of increased PA contributed the most to estimated health benefits, which strongly outweighed detrimental effects of traffic incidents and air pollution exposure on health. Conclusion. Despite different HIA methodologies being applied with distinctive assumptions on key parameters, AT can provide substantial net health benefits, irrespective of geographical context. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Sustainable transport investments linked to improving public transport or designed specifically to improve walking and cycling networks (for example, bicycle infrastructure) typically underestimate the contribution of these active travel modes. This is because the investment appraisal mechanism, social cost benefit analysis, lacks an agreed methodology or well defined parameter values for establishing the demand and the associated health benefits and costs of active travel. Correcting for the acknowledged benefits of walking and cycling (including contributions to achieving physical activity targets and maintaining health) requires an appropriate framework and parameter values to allow these benefits to be captured in a robust and consistent manner. This paper proposes such a framework for the Australian context and a consequent weighted benefit of \$1.68. per km (range \$1.23-\$2.50) for walking and a \$1.12. per km (range \$0.82-\$1.67) for cycling that includes both mortality and morbidity changes resulting from a more active lifestyle. Investigation of the potential health costs associated with motorised travel and reduced physical activity requires further detailed research. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We provide an 8-step procedure for value transfer based on the adjusted unit value transfer technique, with optional input from existing meta analyses of valuation studies. Based on a review of validity tests of value transfer exercises, we recommend using an average error bound of +20-40 \%, and +100\% for complex environmental goods like biodiversity and ecosystem services. Note however, that this uncertainty have to added to the uncertainty in predicting and transferring the physical impacts. Delivarable 3.1 of NEEDS 3a (Spadaro and Rabl 2008) use this asessment of uncertainty in value transfer toghether with an asessment of uncertainty in the other steps of the IPA to show that the overall uncertainty of the resulting generalized external costs estimate can be 1/3 to 3 times the mean extimate for a 68\% confidence interval, and 1/9 to 9 times the mean estimate for a 95 \% confidence interval.},

Methods: A sample of individuals with specific injury diagnoses was drawn from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) database (n = 2,678). A survey form was used to collect additional information about the crash and the health-related outcomes. The predicted number of impaired individuals was calculated by accumulating the risk for all individuals to sustain at least a 1\% permanent medical impairment, based on the injured body region and injury severity. Results: Nine hundred forty-seven individuals (36\%) responded, of whom 44\% reported declined health after the crash. The majority (68\%) were injured in single bicycle crashes, 17\% in collisions with motor vehicles, and 11\% in collisions with another cyclist or pedestrian. Most single bicycle crashes related to loss of control (46\%), mainly due to skidding on winter surface conditions (14\%), followed by loss of control during braking (6\%). There was no significant difference in crash distribution comparing all crashes with crashes among people with declined health. The predicted number of impaired individuals (n = 427) corresponded well with the number of individuals self-reporting declined health (n = 421). Conclusions: The types of crashes leading to health loss do not substantially differ from those that do not result in health loss. Two thirds of injuries leading to health loss occur in single bicycle crashes. In addition to separating cyclists from motorized traffic, other preventive strategies are needed.},

This paper presents the preliminary findings of the intervention's impact on improving employee wellbeing and organisational behaviour, as an indicator of potential business success. Method: Employees of a UK-based organisation participated in a workplace travel behaviour change intervention and used e-bikes as an active commuting mode; this was a change to their usual passive commuting behaviour. The purpose of the intervention was to develop employee wellbeing and organisational behaviour for improved business success. We explored the personal benefits and organisational co-benefits of active commuting and compared these to a travel-as-usual group of employees who did not change their behaviour and continued taking non-active commutes. Results: Employees who changed their behaviour to active commuting reported more positive affect, better physical health and more productive organisational behaviour outcomes compared with passive commuters. In addition, there was an interactive effect of commuting mode and commuting distance: a more frequent active commute was positively associated with more productive organisational behaviour and stronger overall positive employee wellbeing whereas a longer passive commute was associated with poorer wellbeing, although there was no impact on organisational behaviour. Conclusions: This research provides emerging evidence of the value of an innovative workplace health promotion initiatives focused on active commuting in protecting and improving employee wellbeing and organisational behaviour for stronger business performance. It considers the significant opportunities for organisations pursuing improved workforce wellbeing, both in terms of employee health, and for improved organisational behaviour and business success.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore alternative `rapid appraisal' methodologies for determining the costs and benefits of environmental legislation, the focus being the new Chemicals Policy in the European Union (EU) known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals). We show that a full and rigorous cost--benefit appraisal of this legislation is not possible because of informational deficiencies. Hence, some `second best' approach is required. In addition, full cost--benefit appraisal is likely to be expensive and impossible to conduct in the near-term. We argue that it is possible to obtain some broad estimates of gains and losses by making reasonable assumptions and by pursuing different methodologies for estimating benefits. Two methodologies, both based on the notion of a disability-adjusted life year (DALY), are adopted. A DALY is a measure of health loss, enabling different forms of morbidity to be compared with premature mortality. We seek to `monetise' DALYs in order to make a direct comparison with the costs of the policy measures. The first approach addresses health expenditure in the UK and EU, based on the presumption that this expenditure is incurred in order to avoid and treat the causes of DALYs. Health expenditure per DALY is thus a measure of the value of a DALY and this expenditure is avoided by reductions in DALYs due to environmental control. The second approach assigns a willingness-to-pay value to a DALY based on an `anchor' estimate of the `value of a statistical life' (VOSL) and an implied value of a `life year' (VOLY). On the basis of these models we show that while the costs of REACH could be greater than benefits, the second approach reveals a strong probability that benefits exceed costs. Since our models explicitly exclude any environmental benefits, we regard our benefit estimates as minima. Overall, our own judgement is that we feel confident that REACH generates net benefits, a result consistent with other partial studies that have been carried out to date.},

  abstract = {Background: Data on long-term outcomes following an acute stroke are sparse. We assessed survival, risk of recurrent stroke and loss in life expectancy following an acute stroke using population-wide data from Australia and New Zealand. Methods: We included all adults with the first stroke hospitalization during 2008 and 2017 at all public and most private hospitals. Patients were followed up to 10 years after the stroke by linkage to each region's Registry of Deaths and subsequent hospitalizations. Flexible parametric survival modeling was used to estimate all-cause mortality, stroke recurrence, and loss in life expectancy. Competing risk model was used when estimating the risk of stroke recurrence. Results: Three hundred thirteen thousand one hundred sixty-two patients were included (mean age 73.0{\textpm}14.6 y, 52.0\% males) with ischemic stroke (175\,547, 56.1\%) being the most common, followed by hemorrhagic stroke (77\,940, 24.9\%) and unspecified stroke (59\,675, 19.1\%). The overall survival probability was 79.4\% at 3 months, 73.0\% at 1 year, 52.8\% at 5 years, and 36.4\% at 10 years. Cumulative incidence of stroke recurrence was 7.8\% at 3 months, 11.0\% at 1 year, 19.8\% at 5 years, and 26.8\% at 10 years. Hemorrhagic stroke was associated with greater mortality (hazard ratio, 2.02 [95\% CI, 1.99--2.04]) and recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 1.63 [95\% CI, 1.59--1.67]) compared with ischemic stroke. Female sex (hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\% CI, 1.09--1.11]) and increasing age ({$\geq$}85 years versus 18--54 years: hazard ratio, 7.36 [95\% CI, 7.15--7.57]) were also associated with increased mortality. Several risk factors including atherosclerotic coronary and noncoronary vascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of mortality and recurrent stroke. Compared with the general population, an acute stroke was associated with a loss of 5.5 years of life expectancy, or 32.7\% of the predicted life expectancy, and was pronounced in patients with a hemorrhagic stroke (7.4 years and 38.5\% of predicted life expectancy lost). Conclusions: In this population-wide study, death and recurrence of stroke were common after an acute stroke and an acute stroke was associated with considerable loss in life expectancy. Further improvements in treatment and secondary prevention of stroke are needed to reduce these risks.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Pedelecs are bicycles that provide electric assistance only when a rider is pedaling and have become increasingly popular. Purpose: Our purpose was to quantify usage patterns over 4~weeks of real-world commuting with a pedelec and to determine if pedelec use would improve cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: Twenty sedentary commuters visited the laboratory for baseline physiological measurements [body composition, maximum oxygen consumption (V˙ O 2max), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood lipid profile, and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)]. The following 4~weeks, participants were instructed to commute using a pedelec at least 3~days~week-1 for 40~min~day-1 while wearing a heart rate monitor and a GPS device. Metabolic equivalents (METS) were estimated from heart rate data. Following the intervention, we repeated the physiological measurements. Results: Average total distance and time were 317.9~{\textpm}~113.8~km and 15.9~{\textpm}~3.4~h, respectively. Participants averaged 4.9~{\textpm}~1.2 METS when riding. Four weeks of pedelec commuting significantly improved 2-h post-OGTT glucose (5.53~{\textpm}~1.18--5.03~{\textpm}~0.91~mmol~L-1, p~{$<~$}0.05), V˙ O 2max (2.21~{\textpm}~0.48--2.39~{\textpm}~0.52~L~min-1, p~{$<~$}0.05), and end of V˙ O 2max test power output (165.1~{\textpm}~37.1--189.3~{\textpm}~38.2~W, p~{$<~$}0.05). There were trends for improvements in MAP (84.6~{\textpm}~10.5--83.2~{\textpm}~9.4~mmHg, p~=~0.15) and fat mass (28.6~{\textpm}~11.3--28.2~{\textpm}~11.4~kg, p~=~0.07). Conclusion: Participants rode a pedelec in the real world at a self-selected moderate intensity, which helped them meet physical activity recommendations. Pedelec commuting also resulted in significant improvements in 2-h post-OGTT glucose, V˙ O 2max , and power output. Pedelecs are an effective form of active transportation that can improve some cardiometabolic risk factors within only 4~weeks.},

  abstract = {The posted speed limit, as a proxy of actual speed, is one of the most fundamental predictors of active travelers' (pedestrian and bicyclist) injury outcomes when involved in crashes with motor vehicles. Although earlier studies predominantly considered posted speed limit as an exogenous variable and provided highly insightful findings, majorities of them assume the effects of active traveler behavior to remain the same across different posted speed limits, which in turn neglect the heterogeneity in active traveler behaviors on high-speed roads vs. low-speed roads. This study proposes to develop a latent segmentation-based active traveler injury severity model to relax the homogeneity assumption of the posted speed limit by active traveler behavior. Specifically, this study proposes to estimate a latent segmentation-based correlated random parameters generalized ordered logit model to examine active travel injury severity mechanisms. The proposed model accommodates systematic heterogeneity in the effects of posted speed limit, crash year and active traveler group by using a piecewise linear function in injury severity component of the latent segment model. The model is demonstrated by using active traveler crash data from Queensland, Australia, for the years 2015 through 2019. To demonstrate the implications of the estimated models, a number of hypothetical scenario analyses are performed with a specific focus on active traveler behavior and reduction in posted speed limits. The outcomes from the hypothetical scenario analysis highlighted that a 76 \% (73 \%) reduction in active traveler fatalities can be achieved by converting 50--60 km/hr roadways to 10--40 km/hr roadways in the urban areas (rural areas) of Queensland. The outcomes of the study will allow us to identify effective speed management strategies while targeting those with high-risk behavior.},

  abstract = {There is a growing awareness that significant benefits for our health and environment could be achieved by reducing our use of cars and shifting instead to active transport, i.e. walking and bicycling. The present article presents an estimate of the health impacts due to a shift from car to bicycling or walking, by evaluating four effects: the change in exposure to ambient air pollution for the individuals who change their transportation mode, their health benefit, the health benefit for the general population due to reduced pollution and the risk of accidents. We consider only mortality in detail, but at the end of the paper we also cite costs for other impacts, especially noise and congestion. For the dispersion of air pollution from cars we use results of the Transport phase of the ExternE project series and derive general results that can be applied in different regions. We calculate the health benefits of bicycling and walking based on the most recent review by the World Health Organization. For a driver who switches to bicycling for a commute of 5 km (one way) 5 days/week 46 weeks/yr the health benefit from the physical activity is worth about 1300 h/yr, and in a large city (4 500,000) the value of the associated reduction of air pollution is on the order of 30 h/yr. For the individual who makes the switch, the change in air pollution exposure and dose implies a loss of about 20 h/yr under our standard scenario but that is highly variable with details of the trajectories and could even have the opposite sign. The results for walking are similar. The increased accident risk for bicyclists is extremely dependent on the local context; data for Paris and Amsterdam imply that the loss due to fatal accidents is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the health benefit of the physical activity. An analysis of the uncertainties shows that the general conclusion about the order of magnitude of these effects is robust. The results can be used for cost-benefit analysis of programs or projects to increase active transport, provided one can estimate the number of individuals who make a mode shift.},

  abstract = {Background Bicycling has the potential to improve fitness, diminish obesity, and reduce noise, air pollution, and greenhouse gases associated with travel. However, bicyclists incur a higher risk of injuries requiring hospitalization than motor vehicle occupants. Therefore, understanding ways of making bicycling safer and increasing rates of bicycling are important to improving population health. There is a growing body of research examining transportation infrastructure and the risk of injury to bicyclists. Methods We reviewed studies of the impact of transportation infrastructure on bicyclist safety. The results were tabulated within two categories of infrastructure, namely that at intersections (e.g. roundabouts, traffic lights) or between intersections on "straightaways" (e.g. bike lanes or paths). To assess safety, studies examining the following outcomes were included: injuries; injury severity; and crashes (collisions and/or falls). Results The literature to date on transportation infrastructure and cyclist safety is limited by the incomplete range of facilities studied and difficulties in controlling for exposure to risk. However, evidence from the 23 papers reviewed (eight that examined intersections and 15 that examined straightaways) suggests that infrastructure influences injury and crash risk. Intersection studies focused mainly on roundabouts. They found that multi-lane roundabouts can significantly increase risk to bicyclists unless a separated cycle track is included in the design. Studies of straightaways grouped facilities into few categories, such that facilities with potentially different risks may have been classified within a single category. Results to date suggest that sidewalks and multi-use trails pose the highest risk, major roads are more hazardous than minor roads, and the presence of bicycle facilities (e.g. on-road bike routes, on-road marked bike lanes, and off-road bike paths) was associated with the lowest risk. Conclusion Evidence is beginning to accumulate that purpose-built bicycle-specific facilities reduce crashes and injuries among cyclists, providing the basis for initial transportation engineering guidelines for cyclist safety. Street lighting, paved surfaces, and low-angled grades are additional factors that appear to improve cyclist safety. Future research examining a greater variety of infrastructure would allow development of more detailed guidelines.},

  abstract = {Active transportation (walking or cycling) as a substitute for car trips still represents a small percentage of all daily travels in many European cities. This study aimed to estimate the health and economic cobenefits for the adult population of modal shift from driving to active travel in urban environments. Three scenarios were modelled for the case study, the city of Porto, Portugal, by comparing travel patterns of 2013 to hypothetical scenarios of modal shifts from driving to active transport, namely: i) SC1 conservative scenario, with a change of 5\% from driving to cycling and 10\% from driving to walking; ii) SC2 - moderate scenario, with a shift of 10\% and 15\%, respectively; and iii) SC3 - optimistic scenario, with a shift of 15\% and 20\%, respectively. The mortality risk reduction for five health outcomes (colon and breast cancers, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease) was assessed, including an estimation of traffic injury and air pollution exposure risks. Results were presented in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) avoided. Economic valuation for each scenario was performed using a Willingness-toPay approach for morbimortality and a Cost of Illness approach for 2013 hospitalizations and work absenteeism. Significant health benefits were found in all modelled scenarios, ranging from 1657 (16\%) to 2881 (28\%) DALYs avoided. Total costs averted ranged from V3894 to V6769 million through the scenarios. Cardio and cerebrovascular diseases mortality presented the largest benefit, accounting for about 3/4 of all avoidable DALYs in all scenarios. Reductions in CO2 and PM10 emissions were calculated, showing a decrease from 31.6 to 73.7 kt of CO2 and 7 to 16 t for PM10, respectively. A modal shift towards active transportation could lead to significant health and economic benefits, indicating that the evaluation of health impacts should be included in the analysis of active transport interventions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Estimate the health risks and benefits of mode shifts from car to cycling and public transport in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA), creating 8 different scenarios on the replacement of short and long car trips, by public transport or/and bike. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and change in life expectancy related to two different assessments: A) the exposure of travellers to physical activity, air pollution to particulate matter b 2.5 {$\mu$}m (PM2.5), and road traffic fatality; and B) the exposure of general population to PM2.5, modelling by Barcelona Air-Dispersion Model. The secondary outcome was a change in emissions of carbon dioxide. Results: The annual health impact of a shift of 40\% of the car trips, starting and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n=141,690) would be for the travellers who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air pollution, 0.17 additional deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46 deaths avoided from physical activity resulting in a total of 66.12 deaths avoided. Fewer deaths would be avoided annually if half of the replaced trips were shifted to public transport (43.76 deaths). The annual health impact in the Barcelona City general population (n=1,630,494) of the 40\% reduction in car trips would be 10.03 deaths avoided due to the reduction of 0.64\% in exposure to PM2.5. The deaths (including travellers and general population) avoided in Barcelona City therefore would be 76.15 annually. Further health benefits would be obtained with a shift of 40\% of the car trips from the Greater Barcelona Metropolitan which either start or end in Barcelona City to public transport (40.15 deaths avoided) or public transport and cycling (98.50 deaths avoided).The carbon dioxide reduction for shifting from car to other modes of transport (bike and public transport) in Barcelona metropolitan area was estimated to be 203,251 t/CO2 emissions per year. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce car use and increase cycling and the use of public transport in metropolitan areas, like Barcelona, can produce health benefits for travellers and for the general population of the city. Also these interventions help to reduce green house gas emissions.},

We, therefore, undertook a systematic review of all reported injuries/illness in road cycling. Design Systematic review. Data sources Identification of articles was achieved through a comprehensive search of: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception until January 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies reporting injuries/illness in adults participating in road cycling. Cycling commuter studies were excluded from the analysis. Method Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and trial quality. Initial search criteria returned 52 titles and abstracts to be reviewed, with 12 studies included after reviewing the full text articles. Results The most common injuries sustained were abrasions, lacerations and haematomas accounting for 40--60\% of the total injuries recorded. Fractures (6--15\%) were the second most frequent type of injury. Head injuries (including concussions) accounted for 5--15\% of injuries with musculotendinous injuries accounting for 2--17.5\%. The upper limb was more frequently affected by injuries than the lower limb, with amateurs appearing to be at higher risk of injury/illness than professionals. Clavicle was the prevalent fracture, with patellofemoral syndrome the number one overuse diagnosis. No meta-analysis of the results was undertaken due to the inconsistent methods of reporting. Conclusion This is the first systematic review of road cycling injuries. Injuries most often affected the upper limb, with clavicle being the most prevalent fracture and the most common overuse injury being patellofemoral syndrome.},

  abstract = {The overall population in the United States has experienced a marked decline in both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality over the last several decades, including a decline in mortality of individuals with diabetes. However, in association with the obesity epidemic, the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes continue to increase. Despite improvements in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes is an increasingly important risk factor for CVD, and individuals with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes continue to have an increased risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The evaluation of long-term trends in mortality rates of diabetes is particularly challenging. The changing definition of diabetes over the last several decades makes the proportion of diabetes deaths hard to interpret. In addition, death certificate data regarding diabetes are often incomplete and likely underestimate the association of diabetes and mortality. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and individuals with diabetes have a twofold to threefold increased risk of mortality compared to individuals without diabetes. Individuals with diabetes have a decreased life expectancy by up to 8 years compared to contemporary individuals without diabetes. This decrease is due in part to an increased risk of CVD and an increasing attributable risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with diabetes. The most common nonvascular causes of death from diabetes include cancer, renal disease, liver disease, and pneumonia. Individuals with diabetes have increased all-cause mortality even after adjusting for baseline characteristics, including age, sex, smoking status, and body mass index. Control of cardiovascular risk factors has improved over the last several decades in the general population, as well as in individuals with diabetes. However, many individuals with diabetes remain suboptimally controlled based on current standards. Cardiovascular risk factor control has contributed to a decrease in national mortality rates over time, but both women and men with diabetes remain at higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than those without diabetes. The above trends highlight several important points. First, the prevalence and incidence of diabetes continue to increase. Second, despite improvements in cardiovascular risk factor treatment, individuals with diabetes are not optimally controlled. Further, the proportion of CVD due to diabetes has increased over time, emphasizing the impact of increasing diabetes incidence on the burden of CVD. Finally, these findings point to the importance of aggressive diabetes and cardiovascular risk factor management to help decrease diabetes morbidity and mortality.},

They have been used as an outcome indicator in micro economic evaluations as well as sectoral prioritization exercises using league tables of cost-effectiveness. However, many of the current analyses are not comparable or transferable because either the assumptions used differ or are unclear, and because results are not presented in a way that allows researchers or policy-makers to re-calculate and re-interpret findings for use in an alternative context. However, at times there have also been miscalculations. This may happen either because evaluators disagree with the assumptions behind DALYs or because the methods of calculation have not been set out clearly. This paper shows how to calculate DALYs for cost-effectiveness analysis using a worked example. It also shows the impact of changing the age weighting and discount rates on estimates of cost-effectiveness, and suggests a set of minimum reporting criteria for using DALYs in cost-effectiveness analysis. Finally, readers are introduced briefly to a selected literature arguing for and against the use of DALYs.},

The cost--benefit analyses take into account the benefit of reduced insecurity and the health benefits of the improved fitness the use of non-motorized transport provides. In addition to reductions in health costs, the analyses also take into account that a change from travel by car to cycling or walking means reduced external costs (e.g. air pollution and noise) from motorized traffic and reduced parking costs. The benefits of investments in cycle networks are estimated to be at least 4--5 times the costs. Such investments are thus more beneficial to society than other transport investments.},

This paper investigates the differences in accessibility, mobility and activity patterns as a result of radical road space allocation changes. To do so, the TRANUS Land Use and Transport Interaction model is utilized. Also, the city of Southampton is selected as a case study and four scenarios inspired by the city's ongoing or planned active travel initiatives are the ``Business as Usual'' (BAU) scenario, the ``Southampton Cycling Network'' (SCN) scenario, the ``Traffic Calming'' (TC) scenario, and the ``Combined'' scenario, which involves the simultaneous deployment of both test scenarios. In the SCN scenario, the proportion of bicycle trips has noticeably risen, whereas in the TC scenario, public transport usage is maintained. Meanwhile, the Combined scenario significantly diminishes the appeal of private motorized transport over the long term. Regarding the impacts on activities, urban sprawl and the creation of new urban centres are observed in all scenarios. Interestingly, the SCN and combined scenarios have similarities in land use effects, but this happens because accessibility increases in peripheral zones in the former, whereas it reduces in central zones in the latter.},

  abstract = {Introduction: A promising way to stimulate physical activity is to promote the choice for active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions. Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf \& Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment). Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described workplace-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical significance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality. Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described. {\'O} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Bicycle-motor vehicle crashes are concentrated along distributor roads where cyclists are exposed to greater volumes of high-speed motorists than they would experience on access roads. This study examined the road safety impact of network-level separation of vehicular and cycle traffic in Dutch urban networks, a strategy for which the term 'unbundling' is used. Unbundling vehicular traffic and cycle traffic in an urban network is operationalized as the degree to which cyclists use access roads and grade-separated intersections to cross distributors. The effect on the share of cycling in the modal split is also assessed as unbundling may affect the competitiveness of cycling compared to driving in terms of trip length. The analyses were conducted on Dutch municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. Negative binomial regression was used to analyse the effect on the number of police-reported cyclist deaths and in-patients in bicycle-motor vehicle crashes. A mediation model was tested, with Structural Equation Modelling hypothesizing that unbundling corresponds positively with the cycling modal share via the length of car trips divided by those by bicycle. The results of this study suggest that unbundling improves cycling safety, and increases the share of cycling in the modal split. We recommend unbundling vehicular and bicycle traffic in urban networks, e.g. establishing large traffic-calmed areas with short cuts and standalone paths for cyclists (and pedestrians) and, where feasible, grade-separated intersections such as bicycle tunnels.},

This growth has been particularly rapid in the Netherlands, yet very little research has been conducted to assess the road safety implications. This case-control study compares the likelihood of crashes for which treatment at an emergency department is needed and injury consequences for electric bicycles to classic bicycles in the Netherlands among users of 16 years and older. Data were gathered through a survey of victims treated at emergency departments. Additionally, a survey of cyclists without any known crash experience, drawn from a panel of the Dutch population acted as a control sample. Logistic regression analysis is used to compare the risk of crashes with electric and classical bicycles requiring treatment at an emergency department. Among the victims treated at an emergency department we compared those being hospitalized to those being send home after the treatment at the emergency department to compare the injury consequences between electric and classical bicycle victims. The results suggest that, after controlling for age, gender and amount of bicycle use, electric bicycle users are more likely to be involved in a crash that requires treatment at an emergency department due to a crash. Crashes with electric bicycles are about equally severe as crashes with classic bicycles. We advise further research to develop policies to minimize the risk and maximize the health benefits for users of electric bicycles.},

This paper explores how the Netherlands achieved an 80\% reduction in the number of cyclists killed (predominantly bicycle--motor vehicle crashes) per billion bicycle kilometres over a thirty year period. Factors found to contribute to this improvement include the establishment of a road hierarchy with large traffic-calmed areas where through traffic is kept out. A heavily used freeway network shifts motor vehicles from streets with high cycling levels. This reduces exposure to high-speed motor vehicles. Separated bicycle paths and intersection treatments decrease the likelihood of bicycle--motor vehicle crashes. The high amount of bicycle use increases safety as a higher bicycle modal share corresponds with a lower share of driving and greater awareness of cyclists among drivers. Low cycling speed was also found to contribute to the high level of cycling safety in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The rising use of e-bikes (EBs) presents an opportunity to increase active trans\- portation but may compromise road safety due to increased travel speed and weight compared to conventional bicycle (CBs). Evidence comparing the safety of EBs and CBs is limited while the influence of cyclists' health status has been neglected. Methods: This cross-sectional case-control study compared EB and CB users in the Netherlands. Data were gathered 1) through a survey among crash casualties treated at emergency de\- partments aged {$>$}16 (N = 2383) and 2) control group data were collected among cyclists without any known crash experience, randomly drawn from a panel of the Dutch population (N = 1860). Using logistic regressions, we assessed the likelihood of crashes and crash severity while adjusting for bicycle use and health status. Results: EB users had poorer health than CB users, but they were not more likely to be involved in a crash or to sustain more severe injuries. However, older female cyclists did have an elevated risk on EBs and sustained more severe injuries. Health-related factors such as the presence of morbid conditions, medication use, and the body mass index were neither associated with crash likeli\- hood nor associated with injury severity and accordingly did not explain the findings for older females. However, balance and coordination problems, and the use of anti-epileptic drugs were associated with crashes. Conclusion: Our findings provide support that EB users have a poorer health status than CB users, while general health status is unrelated to the likelihood and severity of bicycle crashes. EBs enable more vulnerable groups to cycle or keep cycling but, after controlling for bicycle use, EB users are not more likely to be involved in a crash or to sustain severe injuries. As older females run a higher risk on an EB and are more likely to fall while (dis)mounting, we recommend to promote EBs enabling safer (dis)mounting such as by reduced saddle height.},

Using an event study design, a two-way fixed effects model and the synthetic control group method on geo-coded data, I show that the construction of pop-up bike lanes significantly reduced average car speed by 8 to 12 percentage points (p.p.) and up to 16 p.p. in peak traffic hours. In contrast, the results for car volume are modest, while the data does not allow for a conclusive judgment of accidents.},

But life expectancy and the years of life lost have not been reported. Objectives To quantify mortality, examine how it varies with age, sex, and other risk factors, and determine how life expectancy is affected. Methods We constructed mortality models using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, adjusting for age, sex, race, and major medical conditions. We used these to compute life expectancy and the years of life lost. Measurements and main results Pulmonary function testing classified patients as having Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 COPD or restriction. COPD is associated with only a modest reduction in life expectancy for never smokers, but with a very large reduction for current and former smokers. At age 65, the reductions in male life expectancy for stage 1, stage 2, and stages 3 or 4 disease in current smokers are 0.3 years, 2.2 years, and 5.8 years. These are in addition to the 3.5 years lost due to smoking. In former smokers the reductions are 1.4 years and 5.6 years for stage 2 and stages 3 or 4 disease, and in never smokers they are 0.7 and 1.3 years. Conclusions Persons with COPD have an increased risk of mortality compared to those who do not, with consequent reduction in life expectancy. The effect is most marked in current smokers, and this is further reason for smokers to quit.},

The major factor affecting long term survival (other than age) is known to be the severity of disability. Yet to our knowledge there are no studies reporting life expectancies stratified by both age and severity. Remaining life expectancy is a key measure of health. Methods: We identified 11 long-term follow-up studies of stroke patients that reported the multivariate effects of age, sex, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) grade of disability, and other factors. From these we computed the composite effects of these factors on survival, then used these to calculate age-, sex-, and mRS-specific mortality rates. Finally we used the rates to construct life tables, and hence obtain life expectancies. Results: Life expectancy varies by age, sex, and mRS. The life expectancies of males age 70, for example, were 13, 13, 11, 8, 6, and 5 years for Rankin Grades 0-5, respectively, representing reductions of 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 years from the corresponding general population figure. Conclusions: These figures demonstrate the importance of rehabilitation following stroke, and can be used in discussion of public policy and benchmarking of future results.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} The paper presents an overview of air quality in the 27 member countries of the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (previous EU-28), from 2000 to 2017. We reviewed the progress made towards meeting the air quality standards established by the EU Ambient Air Quality Directives (European Council Directive 2008/50/ EC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines by estimating the trends (Mann-Kendal test) in national emissions of main air pollutants, urban population exposure to air pollution, and in mortality related to exposure to ambient fine particles \-(PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone \-(O3). Results:{\enspace} Despite significant reductions of emissions (e.g., sulfur oxides:\,{\textasciitilde}\,80\%, nitrogen oxides:\,{\textasciitilde}\,46\%, non-methane volatile organic compounds:\,{\textasciitilde}\,44\%, particulate matters with a diameter lower than 2.5 {\textmu}m and 10 {\textmu}m:\,{\textasciitilde}\,30\%), the EU-28 urban population was exposed to \-PM2.5 and \-O3 levels widely exceeding the WHO limit values for the protection of human health. Between 2000 and 2017, the annual P\- M2.5-related number of deaths decreased (- 4.85 per \-106 inhabitants) in line with a reduction of \-PM2.5 levels observed at urban air quality monitoring stations. The rising \-O3 levels became a major public health issue in the EU-28 cities where the annual O\- 3-related number of premature deaths increased (+\,0.55 deaths per \-106 inhabitants). Conclusions:{\enspace} To achieve the objectives of the Ambient Air Quality Directives and mitigate air pollution impacts, actions need to be urgently taken at all governance levels. In this context, greening and re-naturing cities and the implementation of fresh air corridors can help meet air quality standards, but also answer to social needs, as recently highlighted by the COVID-19 lockdowns.},

  abstract = {Purpose:~         The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of the electrically assisted bicycle (EAB) as a novel tool for meeting the physical activity guidelines in terms of intensity.         Methods:~         Twelve habitually active adult subjects were requested to cycle a track of 4.3 km at an intensity they would normally choose for commuter cycling, using three different support settings: no support (NO), eco support (ECO), and power support (POW). For estimating the intensity, the oxygen consumption was measured by using a portable gas-analyzing system, and HR was simultaneously measured. The bicycle was equipped with the SRM Training System to measure subjects' power output, pedaling rate, and the cycle velocity.         Results:~         Mean intensity was 6.1 MET for NO, 5.7 MET for ECO, and 5.2 MET for POW. Intensity was significantly lower in POW compared with that in NO. No differences were found between NO and ECO and between ECO and POW. Mean HR was significantly higher in NO compared with that in ECO and POW. The cycling speed with electrical support settings was significantly higher than cycling in the NO condition. Mean power output during cycling was significantly different among all three conditions. Most power outputs were supplied in the NO condition, and the lowest power output was supplied in the POW condition.         Conclusions:~         Intensity during cycling on an EAB, in all three measured conditions, is sufficiently high to contribute to the physical activity guidelines for moderate-intensity health-enhancing physical activity for adults (cutoff, 3 MET). Further study is needed to conclude whether these results still hold when using the EAB in regular daily life and in subjects with other fitness level.},

  abstract = {Purpose Colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis reduces life expectancy and decreases patients' well-being. We sought to assess the determinants of health and functional status and estimate the proportion of remaining life that CRC survivors would spend in good health. Methods Using Sullivan method, healthy life expectancy was calculated based on survival data of 14,849 CRC survivors within a population-based cancer registry in southern Netherlands and quality of life information among a random sample of these survivors (n~=~1,291). Results Overall, albeit short life expectancy (LE at age 50~=~12~years for males and 13~years for females), most CRC survivors spent a large proportion of their remaining life in good health (74 and 77~\%, for males and females, respectively). Long-term survivors may expect to live a normal life span (LE at age 50~=~30~years) and spent a large proportion of the remaining life in good health (78~\%). In distinction, those with stage IV CRC had less than 2~years to live and spent more than half of their remaining life in poor health. Conclusions Most CRC patients may expect no compromise on living a healthy life, underlining the importance of early detection. On the other hand, the high proportion of non-healthy years among stage IV CRC survivors confirms the importance of early detection and palliative care.

A transport model was used to estimate traffic volumes and current commuting preferences in Stockholm County. The study used individuals' home and work addresses, their age, sex, and an empirical model estimate of their expected physical capacity in order to establish realistic bicycle travel distances. If car commuters with estimated physical capacity to bicycle to their workplace within 30 min changed their mode of transport to bicycle, {$>$}110,000 additional bicyclists would be achieved. Time-weighted mean concentrations along paths were, among current bicyclists, reduced from 25.8 to 24.2 {\textmu}g/m3 for NOx and 1.14 to 1.08 {\textmu}g/m3 for BC. Among the additional bicyclists, the yearly mean NOx dose from commuting increased from 0.08 to 1.03 {\textmu}g/m3. This would be expected to yearly cause 0.10 fewer deaths for current bicycling levels and 1.7 more deaths for additional bicycling.

Methods: In this study registry information on the location of home and work for residents in Stockholm County was used to obtain the shortest travel route on a network of bicycle paths and roads. Current modes of travel to work were based on travel survey data. The relation between duration of cycling and distance cycled was established as a basis for selecting the number of individuals that normally would drive a car to work, but have a distance to work that they could bicycle within 30 minutes. The change in traffic flows was estimated by a transport model (LuTrans) and effects on road traffic injuries and fatalities were estimated by using national hospital injury data. Effects on air pollution concentrations were modelled using dispersion models. Results: Within the scenario, 111,000 commuters would shift from car to bicycle. On average the increased physical activity reduced the one-year mortality risk by 12\% among the additional bicyclists. Including the number of years lost due to morbidity, the total number of disability adjusted life-years gained was 696. The amount of disability adjusted life-years gained in the general population due to reduced air pollution exposure was 471. The number of disability adjusted life-years lost by traffic injuries was 176. Also including air pollution effects among bicyclists, the net benefit was 939 disability adjusted life-years per year.

Eight sedentary women (age: 38 {\textpm} 15 years, BMI: 25.3 {\textpm} 2.1 kg m-2) cycled 9.5 km on varying terrain (change in elevation: 102 m, maximum incline: 5.8 \%) at their own pace, once with and once without motorized assistance, in randomized order. With electrical assistance, the mean power output (-29 \%); EMG patterns of the m. biceps femoris (-49 \%), m. vastus lateralis (-33 \%), m. vastus medialis (-37 \%), and m. gastrocnemius medialis (-29 \%); heart rate (-29.1 \%); oxygen uptake (-33.0 \%); respiratory exchange ratio (-9.0 \%); and EE (-36.5 \%) were all lower, whereas the mean cycling speed was higher (P{$<$}0.05) than that without such assistance. In addition, following assisted exercise the mean blood lactate concentration and RPE were lower (P{$<$}0.05) and ratings of enjoyment higher (P{$<$}0.05). Moreover, motorized cycling was associated with (1) lower EMG with higher power output and speed; (2) less cardiorespiratory and metabolic effort; (3) lower respiratory exchange ratio; (4) lower RPE with more enjoyment; and (5) sufficient EE, according to present standards, to provide health benefits.

  abstract = {Objective: To describe and apply a method to assess the effect on road safety of a modal shift from cars to bicycles. Method: Ten percent of all car trips shorter than 7.5 km were assumed to be replaced by bicycle trips. Single-vehicle and multivehicle crashes involving cars and/or bicycles were considered. The safety of car occupants and cyclists was taken into account as well as the safety of other road users involved in such crashes. The computations were carried out by age and gender. Assuming constant risk (casualties per distance traveled), the expected number of accidents is proportional to the mobility shift. Several types of risk were considered: the risk of being injured as a car driver or cyclist and the risk of being involved as a car driver or cyclist in a crash in which another road user is injured. Results: The results indicated that the total gain of the modal shift was negative for fatalities, which means that there was a net increase in the number of fatalities. The modal shift was advantageous for young drivers and disadvantageous for elderly drivers. In addition, it was more positive for males than for females. The turning point was around the age of 35. For hospitalized casualties, due to the strong influence of the many hospitalized cyclists in nonmotorized vehicle crashes, there was a strong negative overall effect, and the modal shift resulted in a positive effect for 18- and 19-year-old males only. Overall, a small increase (up to 1\%) in the number of cyclist fatalities and a greater increase of 3.5 percent in the number of inpatients was expected. The increase in casualties was mainly due to the proportion of single-vehicle bicycle crashes with serious injuries in relation to the total number of injured cyclists. The effect of the modal shift was shown to depend on age and gender, resulting in fewer casualties for younger drivers and for women. Conclusions: It is possible to provide a first approximation of the effect on road safety of a mobility shift from cars to bicycles. This approximation indicates that, in general, road safety does not benefit from this modal shift. The effect differs for gender and age groups. Elderly drivers are safer inside a car than on a bicycle. For the number of hospitalized casualties, the modal shift increases the number of casualties for practically all ages and both genders.},

Mean speeds and 85th percentile speeds were reduced by 12.2 and 11.6 km/h, respectively. Speed variation was also reduced, and the speed cumulative distributions shifted to the left, indicating further reductions for all speed ranges. The safety evaluation results revealed fatal and injury collisions were significantly reduced by 45.3\% and injuries to vulnerable road users were reduced by 55.3\%. In fact, for every 1 km/h reduction in mean speed, fatal and injury crashes were reduced by about 4\%, which is consistent with findings from previous research. Neither spatial nor temporal collision migration or spillover effects were significant factors in the analysis. Consequently, the results of this study provide strong evidence that reducing speed limits to 30 km/h in school zones can bring significant safety benefits by reducing vehicular speeds and fatal and injury crashes.}

  abstract = {Background: Cycling is considered to have a positive effect on public health through increased physical activity. In Norway, the e-bike is seen as a way of getting more people to cycle. However, the motorized assistance of an e-bike potentially eliminates any physical activity associated with its use. It is possible that the assumed health effect of increased cycling is ``erased'' through a reduction in other physical activities (a substitution effect). In this paper we study the public health effects of e-bikes using a combined cross-sectional and quasi-experimental design. First, we explore the existence of potentially hedonistic values in relation to interest in acquiring an e-bike and, second, we conduct an intervention study of physical activity pre- and post-purchase. Methods: A sample of 340 people responded to a questionnaire before buying an e-bike and follow-up 4 weeks later, when 45 had bought one. A further 28 (mainly physically inactive) were recruited through a Norwegian NGO. For a comparison group, 1995 people were recruited through the Falck National Register of Bicycle Owners. All respondents were asked about the intensity of their cycling, (kilometres cycled in the previous week), walking and physical activity in addition to cycling as means of transport (days and hours). Results: A structural equation model showed that hedonistic life values, and general physical activity, were predictive of interest in buying an e-bike. However people who already cycled a lot showed less interest. The trial showed that increased cycling -- whether as a mean of transport or exercise --was related to higher levels of total physical activity in both groups compared to a comparison group (one-way ANOVA). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that in the Norwegian cycle population there is no substantial substitution effect of physical activity with the introduction of an e-bike. The appeal of the e-bike is strongest among those with little existing interest in, or levels of, physical activity. The net effect of the e-bike therefore seems positive from a public health perspective.},

  abstract = {The effect of transport-related pollution on human health is fast becoming recognized as a major issue in cities worldwide. Cyclists, in particular, face great risks, as they typically are most exposed to tail-pipe emissions. Three avenues are being explored worldwide in the fight against urban pollution: (i) outright bans on polluting vehicles and embracing zero tailpipe emission vehicles; (ii) measuring air-quality as a means to better informing citizens of zones of higher pollution; and (iii) developing smart mobility devices that seek to minimize the effect of polluting devices on citizens as they transport goods and individuals in our cities. Following this latter direction, in this paper we present a new way to protect cyclists from the effect of urban pollution. Namely, by exploiting the actuation possibilities afforded by pedelecs or e-bikes (electric bikes), we design a cyber-physical system that mitigates the effect of urban pollution by indirectly controlling the minute ventilation (volume of air inhaled per minute) of cyclists in polluted areas. Results from a real device are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system.},

Design: Health impact assessment and economic evaluation using a dynamic model over a tenyear period and according to two cycling promotion scenarios. Setting: Cycling to work or school in Florence, Italy. Population: All individuals aged 15 and older commuting to work or school in Florence. Main outcome measures The primary outcome measures were changes in NCD incidence and healthcare direct costs for the Tuscany Regional Health Service (SST) due to increased cycling. The secondary outcome was change in road traffic accidents. Results: Increasing cycling modal share in Florence from 7.5\% to about 17\% (Scenario 1) or 27\% (Scenario 2) could decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 1.2\% or 2.5\%, and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke by 0.6\% or 1.2\%. Within 10 years, the number of cases that can be prevented is 280 or 549 for type 2 diabetes, 51 or 100 for AMI, and 51 or 99 for stroke in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, respectively. Average annual discounted savings for the SST are estimated to amount to {\pounds}400,804 or {\pounds}771,201 in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, respectively. In Florence, due to the high use of vulnerable motorized vehicles (such as scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles), road traffic accidents are expected to decline in both our scenarios. Sensitivity analyses showed that health benefits and savings for the SST are substantial, the most sensitive parameters being the relative risk estimates of NCDs and active commuting. Conclusions: Effective policies and programs to promote a modal shift towards cycling among students and workers in Florence will contribute to reducing the NCD burden and helping long-term economic sustainability of the SST.},

  abstract = {Background: Health impact assessment (HIA) studies are increasingly predicting the health effects of mode shifts in traffic. The challenge for such studies is to combine the health effects, caused by injuries, with the disease driven health effects, and to express the change in the health with a common health indicator. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) combines years lived disabled or injured (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) providing practical indicator to combine injuries with diseases. In this study, we estimate the average YLDs for one person injured in a transport crash to allow easy to use methods to predict health effects of transport injuries. Methods: We calculated YLDs and YLLs for transport fatalities and injuries based on the data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA). In STRADA, all the fatalities and most of the injuries in Sweden for 2007--2011 were recorded. The type of injury was recorded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes. In this study these AIS codes were aggregated to injury types, and YLDs were calculated for each victim by multiplying the type of injury with the disability weight and the average duration of that injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying the age of the victim with life expectancy of that age and gender. YLDs and YLLs were estimated separately for different gender, mode of transport and location of the crash. Results: The average YLDs for injured person was 14.7 for lifelong injuries and 0.012 for temporal injuries. The average YLDs per injured person for lifelong injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were 9.4, 12.8 and 18.4, YLDs, respectively. Lifelong injuries sustained in rural areas were on average 31\% more serious than injuries in urban areas. Conclusions: The results show that shifting modes of transport will not only change the likelihood of injuries but also the severity of injuries sustained, if injured. The results of this study can be used to predict DALY changes in HIA studies that take into account mode shifts between different transport modes, and in other studies predicting the health effects of traffic injuries.},

The study revealed that a significant relationship exists between the mode(s) of transit used in commuting for work and the amount of time participants reported engaging in recreational physical activity outside of the commute. Commuters who had some physical activity in their commute spent more time engaging in additional physical activity for recreation and exercise and participated in a greater number of physical activities. The study findings suggested that some groups, such as health researchers, governmental entities, planners, and transportation analysts, might benefit from further studying this connection.},

  abstract = {Cycling is promoted as a sustainable and healthy mode of transport, which results in an increase in bicycle use in urban areas. Increasing bicycle use comes with growing concerns about cyclist safety. This study examines how the temporal variation in the network-wide exposure to cyclists and motorised vehicles affects bicycle crash frequency. Network-wide hourly volumes of cyclists and motorised vehicles were estimated and regression models were used to identify the effect of the exposure to traffic on bicycle crashes in the city of Utrecht, a Dutch cycling capital. The results show that increasing exposure to motorised vehicles, and to a lesser extent, exposure to cyclists, increases the number of bicycle crashes on 50~km/h roads. For 30~km/h roads, no statistically significant relationship between the exposure to cyclists and bicycle crashes was found. Moreover, it was shown that cyclist crash numbers on 30~km/h roads are less sensitive to an increase in the exposure to motorised vehicles compared to cyclist crash numbers on 50~km/h roads. Furthermore, the exposure to motorised vehicles is a stronger factor affecting the increase in bicycle crashes on roads with bicycle lanes or mixed traffic conditions than on roads with separated bicycle facilities. To conclude, this study shows that road safety for cyclists needs further improvements, as cycling in cities keeps increasing.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently, twenty miles per hour (20mph/30kph) speed limit and zone interventions have been increasingly adopted in various European cities. These 20mph speed limits and zones do not only contribute to road safety but they may also be beneficial for public health outcomes such as active travel, physical activity, and air pollution. We aimed to provide an updated assessment of the evidence for potential health effects of 20mph speed limits and zones. Methods: We searched four electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Transport Research Information Service and assessed the grey literature through keywords related to `20mph' or `30kph' and health outcomes. Results: A total of 23 publications (13 academic and ten grey literature publications) were identified. Overall, 20mph speed limits and zones have clear effects on injuries, collisions, and casualties. The wider effects of 20mph speed limits and zones on public health outcomes such as active travel, physical activity, and air pollution need further evaluation. Several subgroup analyses suggested differential effects for age groups, gender, neighbourhood deprivation level, ethnic background, employment status, health status, and type of road user (e.g., cyclist). Additionally, methodological limitations of the evidence base were highlighted, including challenges regarding exposure and outcome measurement and description, and the difficulty of evaluating changes in public health variables over long follow-up periods when using natural experimental methods. Conclusions: 20mph speed limits and zones have the potential to improve road safety. Whilst the broader public health effects of 20mph remain poorly understood given difficulties in evaluating, the logic path through which 20mph speed limits and zones can benefit public health is clear. Future research should address this gap and consider the broader role that lower speed limits and zones can play in creating healthier cities.},

  abstract = {Background The relationships between physical activity (PA) and both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have predominantly been estimated using categorical measures of PA, masking the shape of the dose-response relationship. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, for the very first time we are able to derive a single continuous PA metric to compare the association between PA and CVD/T2DM, both before and after adjustment for a measure of body weight. Methods and Results The search was applied to MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases for all studies published from January 1981 to March 2014. A total of 36 studies (3~439~874 participants and 179~393 events, during an average follow-up period of 12.3~years) were included in the analysis (33 pertaining to CVD and 3 to T2DM). An increase from being inactive to achieving recommended PA levels (150~minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week) was associated with lower risk of CVD mortality by 23\%, CVD incidence by 17\%, and T2DM incidence by 26\% (relative risk [RR], 0.77 [0.71--0.84]), (RR, 0.83 [0.77--0.89]), and (RR, 0.74 [0.72--0.77]), respectively, after adjustment for body weight. Conclusions By using a single continuous metric for PA levels, we were able to make a comparison of the effect of PA on CVD incidence and mortality including myocardial infarct (MI), stroke, and heart failure, as well as T2DM. Effect sizes were generally similar for CVD and T2DM, and suggested that the greatest gain in health is associated with moving from inactivity to small amounts of PA.},

  abstract = {More than one third of all road deaths in the Netherlands and more than two thirds of seriously injured casualties are cyclists. In recent years these shares have increased, despite the fact that the implementation of Safe System principles has been leading in road safety policy and has been successful in reducing the total number of road deaths. However, the annual number of fatalities among cyclists failed to decline and the number of injuries among cyclists has been increasing, especially in single-bicycle crashes. This raises the question why until now Safe System implementation has failed to contribute to the reduction of the number of casualties among cyclists. This question is urgent because of the goal to reduce the number of road deaths and serious traffic injuries in the Netherlands to (virtually) ZERO by 2050. This ambition is in line with the objectives of the European Union. The causes of the unfavourable developments in road safety for cyclists in the Netherlands and which problems require a solution are examined. This raises two questions: can improved implementation of Safe System measures reverse the negative trend, and can this result in ZERO cycling casualties in the future. The discussion involves investigating three dimensions: exposure, crash risk, and injury risk. The opportunities that technological developments may offer in future decades are also considered. It is concluded that Safe System implementation will include opportunities to make cycling considerably safer in the Netherlands. However, we face too many uncertainties to allow for developing scenarios that show how close the Netherlands will be to ZERO cyclists casualties.},

  abstract = {Background Although previous studies have found physical activity to be associated with lower mortality, the dose--response relationship remains unclear. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we quantify the dose--response relationship of non-vigorous physical activity and all-cause mortality. Methods We aimed to include all cohort studies in adult populations with a sample size of more than 10 000 participants that estimated the effect of different levels of light or moderate physical activity on all-cause mortality. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane (DARE), Web of Science and Global Health (June 2009). We used dose--response meta-regression models to estimate the relation between non-vigorous physical activity and mortality. Results We identified 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria, containing 977 925 (334 738 men and 643 187 women) people. There was considerable variation between the studies in their categorization of physical activity and adjustment for potential confounders. We found that 2.5 h/week (equivalent to 30 min daily of moderate intensity activity on 5 days a week) compared with no activity was associated with a reduction in mortality risk of 19\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 15--24], while 7 h/week of moderate activity compared with no activity reduced the mortality risk by 24\% (95\% CI 19--29). We found a smaller effect in studies that looked at walking alone. Conclusion Being physically active reduces the risk of all-cause mortality. The largest benefit was found from moving from no activity to low levels of activity, but even at high levels of activity benefits accrue from additional activity.},

  abstract = {Background Achieving health benefits while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport offers a potential policy win-win; the magnitude of potential benefits, however, is likely to vary. This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London. Methods Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools. Results This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases. Conclusions Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.},

These trips would mostly otherwise have been made on foot (31\%) or by public transport (47\%). To date there has been a trend towards fewer fatalities and injuries than expected on cycle hire bicycles. Using these observed injury rates, the population benefits from the cycle hire scheme substantially outweighed harms (net change -72 DALYs (95\% credible interval -110 to -43) among men using cycle hire per accounting year; -15 (-42 to -6) among women; note that negative DALYs represent a health benefit). When we modelled cycle hire injury rates as being equal to background rates for all cycling in central London, these benefits were smaller and there was no evidence of a benefit among women (change -49 DALYs (-88 to -17) among men; -1 DALY (-27 to 12) among women). This sex difference largely reflected higher road collision fatality rates for female cyclists. At older ages the modelled benefits of cycling were much larger than the harms. Using background injury rates in the youngest age group (15 to 29 years), the medium term benefits and harms were both comparatively small and potentially negative., Conclusion London's bicycle sharing system has positive health impacts overall, but these benefits are clearer for men than for women and for older users than for younger users. The potential benefits of cycling may not currently apply to all groups in all settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Motor vehicle emissions contribute nearly a quarter of the world's energy-related greenhouse gases and cause non-negligible air pollution, primarily in urban areas. Changing people's travel behaviour towards alternative transport is an efficient approach to mitigate harmful environmental impacts caused by a large number of vehicles. Such a strategy also provides an opportunity to gain health co-benefits of improved air quality and enhanced physical activities. This study aimed at quantifying co-benefit effects of alternative transport use in Adelaide, South Australia. Method: We made projections for a business-as-usual scenario for 2030 with alternative transport scenarios. Separate models including air pollution models and comparative risk assessment health models were developed to link alternative transport scenarios with possible environmental and health benefits. Results: In the study region with an estimated population of 1.4 million in 2030, by shifting 40\% of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) by passenger vehicles to alternative transport, annual average urban PM2.5 would decline by approximately 0.4 {$\mu$}g/m3 compared to business-as-usual, resulting in net health benefits of an estimated 13 deaths/year prevented and 118 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented per year due to improved air quality. Further health benefits would be obtained from improved physical fitness through active transport (508 deaths/year prevented, 6569 DALYs/year prevented), and changes in traffic injuries (21 deaths and, 960 DALYs prevented). Conclusion: Although uncertainties remain, our findings suggest that significant environmental and health benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces even a relatively small portion of car trips. The results may provide assistance to various government organisations and relevant service providers and promote collaboration in policy-making, city planning and infrastructure establishment.},

The advancement of charging technology reduces the limitation of charging duration, but it presents some economic challenges. In this study, we analyze the economics of BEBs with different charging rates from real data in Shanghai. We develop a total cost of ownership (TCO) framework considering subsidies, the time-of-use price, and the battery replacement. Our results indicate that fast-charging BEBs are more expensive than slow-charging BEBs due to higher charging equipment costs and the impact of fast charging on battery lifespan. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that operational subsidies are the primary factor influencing the TCO, particularly for slow-charging BEBs. Our research also provides a segmentation of BEB length types across various districts to assist operators in making economically decisions.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study attempts to quantify the difference in loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for patients with operable and inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods: A cohort consisting of 1652 pathologically verified NSCLC patients with performance status 0--1 was monitored for 7 years (2005--2011) to obtain the survival function. This was further extrapolated to lifetime, based on the survival ratios between patients and age- and sex-matched referents simulated from the life tables of the National Vital Statistics of Taiwan. Between 2011 and 2012, EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaires were used to prospectively measure the quality-of-life (QoL) of a 518 consecutive, cross-sectional subsample. We adjusted the lifetime survival function by the utility values of QoL for the cancer cohort to obtain the QALE, while that for the age and sex-matched referents were adjusted to the values collected from the 2009 National Health Interview Survey, and the difference between them was the loss-of-QALE. Results: The QALE for patients with operable and inoperable NSCLC were 11.66 {\textpm} 0.18 and 1.43 {\textpm} 0.05 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with the corresponding loss-of-QALE of 5.25 {\textpm} 0.18 and 14.24 {\textpm} 0.05 QALY, respectively. The lifetime utility difference for patients with operable and inoperable NSCLC was 9.00 {\textpm} 0.18 QALY, after adjustment for QoL and lead-time bias. Conclusion: The utility gained from surgical operation for operable lung cancer is substantial, even after adjustment for lead-time bias. Future studies should compare screening programs with treatment strategies when carrying out cost-utility assessments to improve patients' values.},

  abstract = {Cities have been suffering from severe air pollution for decades due to intensive energy related production and consumption activities. Exposure to hazardous PM2.5 would not only trigger human health impact, but also result in an economic loss for both society and individual. In this study, the PM2.5-related health impact and corresponding economic loss are assessed in typical cities from north part of China. In these cities, huge amount of energy is consumed for space heating during the cold days, which has been proven to be the major contributor to PM2.5 emissions. Considering the remarkable difference of space heating utilization and average PM2.5 concentration, the study examines the health and welfare impact of PM2.5 exposure in both winter season and summer season from 2013 to 2016. Adjusted human capital method and the cost of illness are applied to assess the economic loss of premature death and medical expenses on PM2.5-related diseases, respectively. Welfare loss is proposed to quantify the financial damages caused by PM2.5 to the individual, which is calculated based on the proportion of health care expenses in disposable personal income. The results show that the number of cases for PM2.5-related mortality and morbidity during the winter season is about three times as much as that in summer season in 28 cities. If the annual average PM2.5 concentration has decreased from the current polluted condition to 35\,{$\mu$}g/m3 (national health standard), about 16.46\,billion Yuan, 0.54\% of gross domestic product in 28 cities can be saved annually during the study period. The welfare loss in cities of provincial capital is obviously higher than other cities from the same province, which is associated with the higher consumption level and living quality of capital cities. Moreover, patients requiring hospital admission from rural household are more likely to be impoverished than that from urban household, which aggravates the economic burden of rural residents to recover from the suffer of PM2.5-related diseases. Estimation of the health impact and economic losses for the society and individual represent an integral part of a full analysis of the consequences of PM2.5 exposure to human beings, which can provide some insightful observations for policy makers to keep the social equality, welfare and environment conservation.},

This paper endeavored to assess the effectiveness of city-wide 30 km/h speed limits in Europe. In an effort to condense research outputs, a quantitative approach along with qualitative assessments were implemented. This study described the changes in safety, environment, energy, traffic, livability, and health before and after the phased implementation of city-wide 30 km/h speed limits. The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results from 40 different cities across Europe, including Brussels, Paris, and Zurich, indicated that reductions in speed limits improved road safety by decreasing the likelihood of crash risk and the severity of crashes that do occur. On average, the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits in European cities demonstrated a 23\%, 37\%, and 38\% reduction in road crashes, fatalities, and injuries, respectively. Lower speed limits also yielded environmental benefits, with emissions decreasing on average by 18\%, noise pollution levels by 2.5 dB, and fuel consumption by 7\%, indicating enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Encouraging citizens to embrace walking, cycling and utilizing public transit services can further contribute to a safer and environmentally sustainable urban environment.},

  abstract = {Background Differences in minute ventilation between cyclists, pedestrians and other commuters influence inhaled doses of air pollution. This study estimates minute ventilation of cyclists, car and bus passengers, as part of a study on health effects of commuters' exposure to air pollutants. Methods Thirty-four participants performed a submaximal test on a bicycle ergometer, during which heart rate and minute ventilation were measured simultaneously at increasing cycling intensity. Individual regression equations were calculated between heart rate and the natural log of minute ventilation. Heart rates were recorded during 280 two hour trips by bicycle, bus and car and were calculated into minute ventilation levels using the individual regression coefficients. Results Minute ventilation during bicycle rides were on average 2.1 times higher than in the car (individual range from 1.3 to 5.3) and 2.0 times higher than in the bus (individual range from 1.3 to 5.1). The ratio of minute ventilation of cycling compared to travelling by bus or car was higher in women than in men. Substantial differences in regression equations were found between individuals. The use of individual regression equations instead of average regression equations resulted in substantially better predictions of individual minute ventilations. Conclusion The comparability of the gender-specific overall regression equations linking heart rate and minute ventilation with one previous American study, supports that for studies on the group level overall equations can be used. For estimating individual doses, the use of individual regression coefficients provides more precise data. Minute ventilation levels of cyclists are on average two times higher than of bus and car passengers, consistent with the ratio found in one small previous study of young adults. The study illustrates the importance of inclusion of minute ventilation data in comparing air pollution doses between different modes of transport.},
